## Examples of Applying Bayes Rule in Processing

This repository collects a series of Processing sketches demonstrating the use Bayes Rule. It was created as part of [Makematics at ITP in Fall 2012](http://makematics.com/syllabus/2012-fall).

What follows is a description of the sketches contained herein:

### A Basic Demonstration of Bayes Rule

Expressed in the classic form of an imperfect test for a rare disease. Calculates all four probabilities possible with the two different test results.

### Bayesian Localization

A demonstration of determining the position of a "robot" in 1 dimension given a set of uncertain sensor readings.

This was adapted from Unit 1 of Sebastian Thrun's [Udacity Self-Driving Car class](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373/CourseRev/apr2012)

### Bayesian Spam Filtering

An implementation of Paul Graham's classic technique from [A Plan for Spam](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html). Adapted from [this java implementation by Dan Shiffman](http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/bayesian/).
