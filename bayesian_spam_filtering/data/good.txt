Do not miss out Korean bath houses when you are in Korea.  I took  
dancers (american) and my husband (puertorican) there a couple of  
years ago and they were absolutely in LOVE with spending time in  
Korean bath house.  It is called "Jjim-jil-bang".  You might have to  
ask around which ones are the best ones and they are all over, open  
24 hours a day 7days a week.  It is the best place to go especially  
after you get off of a 14 hour flight.

Another place I would recommend is visitng Kyung-Joo and Andong Ha- 
Heh-ma-eul (I have no idea how else to write it in English) if you  
are interested in seeing some very old historical sites.  Also, I  
would recommend that you would go to the West coast of Korea.  It is  
not a preferable place to swim, but some place like, "Kae-hwa", "sam- 
chun-po", "suh-po" have muddy bays and the scenery in these places is  
something else.  The Yellow Sea is located between China and the  
Korean Peninsula and the name comes from the sand particles that  
color its water, originating from the yellow river.  I didn't  
appreciate the beauty of the west coastline until I grew older.....

Have a great trip!!

Bob,
Continuing the discussion - I'm told that the public areas; dayrooms  
and such of Alderson are/were covered by a number of cameras and the  
footage should be available to us under freedom of information. After  
all, it is a federal government institution...our taxes etc

This surely is the Real reality of Martha Stewart. Forget her  
apprentice or the syndication show. The prison footage would be  
Martha Stewart's version of Big Brother, or maybe with her and the  
prisoners it would be more Surreal World. It's not Inside Martha  
Stewart. It's Martha Stewart Inside. If there isn't enogh action for  
a series or special (how many ways are there to dress up a prison  
uniform) then how about a segment of "Martha's Time" for our Reality  
Remix Show ?

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>


  Please note: We've had to revise our dates to avoid conflicts with ACM
  Group 2005
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ----------------------------
  The 2nd Annual IBM TJ Watson HCI Symposium November 18, 2005
  As We May Work: Advancing Social Technologies for the Distributed
  Enterprise

  Call for Abstracts (Graduate Students Only)
  The structure of organizations is being rapidly transformed:
  Increases in
  mobile workers, globally distributed teams, and federated
  enterprises are
  changing the environment in which we work.  These and other factors
  disrupt
  workers' established means of knowing within the enterprise and
  create new
  challenges and opportunities for them.  Social technologies offer
  means for
  evolving more suitable work practices that flexibly draw on
  distributed
  expertise. These include technologies that support interaction with
  known
  colleagues as well as technologies that seek to leverage the
  knowledge and
  expertise of strangers.  This symposium seeks to provide rich and
  analytical descriptions of how these important advances are
  transforming
  enterprises, describe the technologies on which these advances
  rest, and
  prognosticate what trends will emerge in unlocking the collaborative
  potential of enterprises.

  Example topics:
   Expertise brokers and connectors
   Blogs and wikis for professional reputation creation and
  distribution of
  information
   Technologies that enable more productive distributed work
   Socially-aware code management systems
   Social network visualization to compound social capital
   Collaborative augmentation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
  systems
   Technologies to better support mobile workers
   Technologies that better mobilize the collective intelligence of an
  enterprise

  Participants
  We are seeking contributions from currently matriculated graduate
  students,
  particularly those in departments of Human Computer Interaction,
  Computer
  Science, Management Science, Organizational Science, and Learning
  Sciences.
  Students are asked to submit an extended abstract (1000 words)
  describing
  their work, a current CV, and a supporting letter from their advisor.
  Students whose abstracts are accepted will be provided with limited
  travel
  funds.

  Dates (Please note revised dates)
  Submission deadline:          October 10, 2005
  Acceptance notification:      October  24, 2005

Oxford for groups seems okay. Oxford for the self-employed is  
dreadful. It is called Oxford Liberty, and Oxford won't let you pay  
more to join one of their groups if you are self-employed. You are  
stuck with Liberty. NYU Hospital (Tisch) won't even admit you if  
that's what you've got. Many of the doctors who used to accept  
Liberty won't any longer. They explain that Liberty coverage  
reimburses doctors at a rate lower than medicare's rate. I had a knee/ 
skiing/ER moment in February that Oxford still hasn't paid for. They  
won't pay me although Vail Hospital wouldn't accept their card so I  
had to pay in full to leave. For unexplained reasons, they won't pay  
the hospital either.

Does that mean I have to give it back?

Not totally up the Technology Alley - but it is a great company in  
San Francisco, with good values run by someone I can personally  
certify as on the ball and cool! (my sister rocks.)

I would do the print ad myself, but I haven't done print since 1997  
and I'll end up using web-safe colors or something silly...

Let me know if anyone is interested...

Hi Friends,
 
Net Impact is currently looking for two important roles.  Please  
forward to anyone you think might be interested!
 
Print Ad Campaign Design
 
For the first time, Net Impact is launching a print ad campaign.  We  
have already secured space in several high profile magazines, but we  
need help creating the print ad portfolio.  Ideally there is a  
designer out there who would like to create our ad portfolio pro  
bono,.  Their work would appear in Worthwhile Magazine, Sustainable  
Industries Journal, Business Ethics, Time Magazine (potentially!),  
our annual guidebook and beyond!  Please email me if you or someone  
you know is interested.
 
Development Director
 
We are currently looking for a full time Development Director to join

It looks like all my favorite Prague Coffee Shops are gone, but  
here's one:

Cafe Meduza
Prague 2 - Vinohrady
Belgicka 17

Food:
Pizza Kmotra Kavárna (Tasty pizza)
V Jirchá?ích 12, Praha 1

Kavarna Velryba (Open late.  Lots of veggie options)
Opatovicka, 24

Museums/Galleries:
Black Madonna House - Museum of Czech cubism - National Gallery (D?m  
U ?erné Matky Bo?í - Muzeum ?eského kubizmu)
Ovocn? trh 19/ Celetná 34
The Museum of Czech cubism called the Black Madonna House is a unique  
cubist building from 1911-1912 designed by Josef Gocar. The Museum  
was built at a place of the ruined old house (originally called House  
at the Black Madonna) belonging to Granovsky´s Knighthood. On the  
first floor of this fourth floor building, there used to be coffee  
lounge, very well-known mostly among artists.

Museum of Alfons Mucha (Muzeum Alfonza Muchy)
Panská 7
A museum of Czechoslovakia's best-known art-nouveau artist, Alfons  
Mucha (1860-1934) is situated in the 18th century Kaunitz Palace in  
the very heart of Prague. The collection of Alfonz Mucha Museum  
includes lithographs, paintings, drawings, pastels, statues,  
photographs, sketchbooks and many of the Paris posters he created for  
Sarah Bernhardt. In the Museum, there is also a pleasant terrace café  
and a shop offering exclusive selection of gifts with Alfons Mucha  
motifs.

Gambra
?ernínská 5, Hrad?any, Praha 1, Tel: +420 220 514 527, Website:  
www.illumin.co.uk, Tram 22/23, Open: Mar-Oct noon-6pm Wed-Sun, Nov- 
Feb noon-5.30pm Sat/Sun, Closed all other days, Show Map
Owned by the surrealist animator Jan ?vankmajer, Gambra is, without  
doubt, one of Prague's most interesting galleries. Chock full of  
sculptures, ceramics and lithographs by both Jan and his wife Eva,  
the couple's work continues the tradition of Prague's well- 
established surrealist movement (which has existed in the city since  
the 1920s). Including works by Karel Baron and Eva Medková, the  
gallery also carries books, videos, periodicals and prints relevant  
to the genre. Recommended.

Go see some theatre!
(By the by, all the theatres have cafes.)

Hey -

A friend of mine is coming to town and needs a place to stay for a  
few days.  Preferably a 2 bedroom apartment that can fit 2 couples  
and 1 baby, from Sept 28 to Oct 3.

Or 2 one-bedroom apartments can work as well.

Manhattan preferable, but they will consider other places.

Please email me directly.
thanks!
Midori.

Dear Listees,

hypothetically speaking, suppose someone wanted to use an external

line audio input to his or her g4 laptop for, oh i don't know, recording
off of a turntable or something. is there any way to accomplish this? i
have inspected the entire 15" area of this machine and found no mini

(save the headphone jack).  are there usb microphones or analog-to-usb

I've never personally used it, but I know scott fitz swears by his

imic, which is a USB audio device that give you a mini jack for line  
in and
another for line out

It's pretty cheap on amazon, like under $30

Ok, different question. I have the current 12" powerbook - line in  
only, it seems.

Is there a way to get that input to take "mic in" - ie: use a cheapo  
desktop mic, instead of having to buy a USB thingy? The built-in Mic  
hole is not sufficient for podcasting/light recording.

Subject: taking video of cell phones
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>




Hi List,

I need to get video documentation of various cell phone interfaces.
Currently, I am using the studio camera wich is a just point and  
shoot camera
that only takes 320 by 240, and it is difficult to focus on the screen.

Does anyone have experience taking video of screen-based subjects? I  
need t o
see the graphics on the screen plus the user's hands pressing hard  
buttons.

Is there a reasonably priced digital video camera (around 500-800)  
that can
sync up with the screen.

Any help would be very, very much appreciated

thanks
Jen Levin

You need to be able to get closeup- like to within 3-5 inches of your  
subject. I used a Panasonic DVX100a with no problems. Refresh rate  
was not a problem for me, plus the DVX has variable shutter rates.

It aint 5-800 though. More like 2500. I bet some of the Sony's in  
this range will have variable shutter rates and manual focus, not  
sure about the range though...

Subject: Help: XP laptop (wireless) on Airport network
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

I'm trying to get my mom's laptop, running Windows XP, onto my  
wireless network. The laptop sees and connects to the network. It's  
getting a valid IP from the router (Airport Express base station).  
But, it's not seeing the internet. It's been a long time since I've  
been a PC person (I'm starting to remember why!) so I don't know if  
I'm missing a crucial step.

Any hints?

Ok, you're seeing it's getting an IP, but can't reach the net

Try setting an IP, Router and DNS manually?
Start..control panel...network settings...the wireless  
connection....right click and get it's properties

In the middle on the "general tab" click "internet protocol"
Use the "Use the following ip address" - type in a valid one for your  
net - default gateway is your Airport router.
Use the following DNS - you should be able to see that from another  
machine...

in the Authentication tab make sure 802.1X is off.

Always play with this stuff with WEP off  on your airport - if it  
works without authentication and doesn't with authentication then  
google on WEP Airport and the wifi card or laptop your mom has and  
see if anyone else solved the problem...

okay, i'll admit it.  i'm thoroughly confused by ariel sharon.
he starts as a hawk, with strong-arm diplomacy.
he pisses off his own party.
he builds a massive wall through many israeli and palestinian  
communities.
he orders the gaza pullout and removes some settlements.
now he says he wants peace between israel and palestine.
he says jerusalem belongs to israel, period.

i feel like he's all over the map.  i often think he's a prick.  on  
the other hand, sometimes i think what he's doing is great, but i'm  
always skeptical and i feel like there's something i'm missing.

can anyone explain what is going on with sharon?  biased opinions are  
as welcome as even ones.

Giving up Gaza is hardly as profound in the Jewish psyche as giving up
Jerusalem!

Every year, when Jews celebrate Passover, they reminisce about the exile
their ancestors faced, and they say "next year in Jerusalem".  They mean
that things may be less than dandy here now, but one day Jews will  
return
to occupy that sweet promised land.
cally, given the unpopularity of the forever stagnant peace talks.
Zionists, being very down to earth people, took that literally and  
settled
Jerusalem.  Most of your non-Israeli Jewish friends from ITP take a more
abstract symbolic view of the concept of a promised land and think of  
the
real Jerusalem as a nice place for a sweltering ethnic vacation.

So for Sharon to pull out the settlements, build a wall, contain the
Palestinians, force a Jewish majority population within Israel "proper",
and patrol clear borders for suicide bombers is relatively easy
politically compared to giving up the symbol of Jewish identity.

I'm not as connected to the Israeli political scene as I used to be,  
so I
make no claims to know what is going on in Sharon's head, but Gaza  
was big
headache for Israel, and not particularly strategically important, so it
made sense to get out.

Nobody really understands Sharon these days. (Except maybe his best  
friend
in the world, George W. Bush).
The Israeli right wing (and the right wing part of his ?Likud?  
party, the
so called ?rebels?) is very upset with his redrew from Gaza.
For the first time they understand that a building of a Palestinian  
state
on the 67 borders is possible and happening. The vision of a ?Greater
Israel? (which in some biblical sources include what is today Jordan,  
and
parts of Egypt and Syria) is fading away.
Sharon has made a huge step in the right direction no one before him has
ever made. He made a step that a left wing Israeli government would  
never
be able to execute (just like ironically, the peace agreements with  
Egypt
and the Israeli redrew from Sinai where made by Begin, a right wing  
prime
minister under a right wing government, after years of Israeli left wing
government domination who didn?t agree even to conceder a redrew from
?Israeli territories").
On the other hand, there is no good in life with out some evil to bounce
it (Ying-Yang)
Sharon and his government are still going on with building the  
separation
wall, and enlarging the Jewish settlements in the west bank.
So the Israeli left wing activists are not happy with his ?diversity
method? of sacrificing Gaza, to ?save? the west bank and Jerusalem. I
guess that now, the straggle has moved to the west bank.
I personally do not think that Israel have any other choice than to  
redrew
to the 1967 borders, with the exemption of a couple of Jewish cities  
that
are physically in the west bank but are very close to the Israeli state
border.
In return, Israel will ?sacrifice? some of its pre-1967 territories,  
in
some other parts of the Israeli state (for example a land "bridge"  
between
the Gaza strip and the south side of the west bank.).
As for the Jerusalem question, I truly believe that Jerusalem is big
enough to serve as a capitol for the two states.
This could be an example to the rest of the world; one holly city (also
called the "city of peace") could serve two states; Israel and  
Palestine.
This could be a true "OR LA-GOYIM" (in hebrew- a Light to those who are
non Jewish).
Having said that, I fear that the Anarchy in Gaza, and the total control
of the "HAMAS" and other armed groups over the streets of Gaza, is not
helping Israelis to feel safe enough, to move forward with this  
process. I
do believe that right now, the ball is in the Palestinian court.
I have seen the separation wall in Jerusalem on my last visit. I was  
also
lucky to see the Berlin wall before its fall in 1988.
The Israeli wall is two times higher than the Berlin one. I might post
some pictures of me standing next to it on my web site. It's amazing how
big this wall is.
But walls could be moved, or brought down.
We most keep some hope in both nations minds.

I think it is an interesting development.  Wasn't Rabin assassinated
10 years ago by a right wing Israeli who was angry that he was
considering pulling out of some occupied territories?  So it takes the
very man who came up with the idea of settlements in the first place
to disband the settlements?

I'm similarly medium-to-low involvement... but, I understood the gaza
pullout after it was announced that he would expand in the much more
strategically/practically important Golan (where the water's at,  
nearer to
the borders of Jordan, Syria,  and Lebanon.)

water and military maneuverability seem more important to Sharon than an
organic farm in Gaza.

not sure about his relationship w/Bush other than the well-known  
(Christian
Right loves Israel cause it's part of the path to the return of JC,  
and the
end of our earthly suffering, or, something like that...). GWB = US as a
Christian nation.

The Golan situation is again, a whole different story (I can't imagine
people who leave out side of Israel managing to follow up and understand
all that is going in this country that is the size of Delaware state).
The Golan was concurred in the 1967 war from Syria.
It's Syria who asks to return to the Golan, not the Palestinians.
Because the Golan is still under Israeli rule, Syria and Israel are  
still
in a situation of war.
Because of the nature of the area, we could always find a connection to
the Palestinian struggle for independence.
(A good example would be the firing of 2 rockets in Jordan by Al-Qaeda
people. One was aimed at an American ship; the second was aimed at  
Eilat,
a quiet Israeli resort city)
Sharon is threatening Syria with the Golan issue, because Syria is the
main fond and weapons provider for some militant Palestinians groups in
gaza, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

And so, the violence goes on

Subject: Re: peace?
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Well, it seems an odd question for this list, here's my .02.  In  
addition to the ideas mentioned in prior posts here, the following  
interpretations have been bandied about:

- Sharon is giving up Gaza to solidify Israeli control of large parts  
on the West Bank.

- Sharon is 75 years old, he's one of the last Israeli politicians  
with a strong connection to the founding years of the state.  He  
wants to make peace and a sustainable, prosperous Israel his legacy,  
and, looking at the cast of clowns who are likely to succeed him as  
PM in the future, has decided to play hard for a real settlement to  
the israel-palestine conflict

- Sharon recognizes the ultimate emergence of the Palestinian state  
as a fait accompli and sees this moment as the best opportunity to  
get a good deal for Israel.  Particularly important to him are East  
Jerusalem, and the large settlements near it and Israel's 'narrow  
waist'.

- The whole settlements thing started off, at least in the political  
backrooms where the resources to it were allocated, as a way to  
develop bargaining chips for future settlements and as a way to annex  
land that was seen as strategically important.  But, you know how  
these things go, when you marry expansionist ideology with religious  
manifest destiny (used to attract settlers to the territories to  
begin with), things often get out of hand.

Gaza is fairly unstrategic, so it's more trouble than it's worth.   
It's also worth noting in this context, that the separation wall  
currently includes approximately 9% of the territory of the West  
Bank, and it's route is probably a good indication of what Israel  
expects to get from the west bank in a final settlement.

- Sharon expects Gaza under Palestinian autonomy to be a disaster, so  
they're setting everyone up for an 'I told you so'.

- Sharon hopes that the need for responsible government in Gaza, and  
the breathing room it provides for at least a part of the palestinian  
population will help to transform some aspects of the israeli- 
Palestinian relationship and provide the PA a motivation to become  
the sole armed group in the area (google 'Altalena affair' for  
related background on this)

To a certain extent these motivations are contradictory, but I think  
they're all true to some degree.  Recent events hopefully provide a  
rupture in the status quo that may open the opportunity for  
unexpected good things, especially if Sharon's intentions are  
sincere.  On the other hand, if we start to quickly see a lot of  
provocations from the Israeli side, like assassinations, etc, it may  
be that the intentions are more cynical.  (although I'm hopeful for  
the former, esp. given the recent freak outs by benjamin Netanyahu,  
who you'd expect to play ball a little better if the goal here was  
failure)

I have 6 installs of MediaWiki

Haven't played with any others really, but I like it a lot.  Easy to  
install, configure, and looks good out of the box.  Only downside is  
that it seems a little slow, but maybe that's just me.

Here is a decent list of a bunch of the ones out there:

I wouldn't necessarily buy from them, but it will give you further  
places to go.

The google key words are "plasma touch overlay"

But to answer your original question, I, too, have heard negative  
things about
Earth LCD.  We use ELO panels all the time, however, and they work  
fine. Pretty good customer support, too.

As far as fabricators go, we work with Maltbie a lot, in southern  
Jersey.  If your project is too small for them, they may be able to  
point you to someone good (and closer).  Here's a contact:

Al Darrone
adarrone@maltbie.com
http://www.maltbie.com/

They are really nice guys and do quality work.  Tell them that I sent  
you. (Sasha from BBI)

Another, smaller company, right over the border in PA is USA Models,  
inc.  They also do really nice work.
Talk to Maureen, there.
MConnaughton@usainc.com
http://www.usainc.com/

It's a question of budget, somewhat.  These guys are both really  
good, but might be too pricey if you are working on a physical  
computing budget.

There should be some interesting presentations and great

And if that's not enough, our hosts at the AP also claim they'll be

Hoping to see you there.

Oppose these Bills that Threaten to Destroy Community Media!
Public Access TV is Under Attack!
The Senate “Broadband Investment and Consumer Choice Act” (S.1504)  
and House
and Senate “Video Choice Act of 2005” (H.R.3146 & S.1349) could  
end funding
for the creation of programming, for training, for access to  
equipment and
studios. They could end funding for MNN’s Community Media Grants,  
and could
strip MNN of channel space on cable TV.  These Bills could end free and
democratic public communication in the Borough of Manhattan, and at  
every
other Public Access TV center around the country.

These Bills would silence the diversity of voices heard and take  
valuable
media resources away from our communities.  It could eliminate  
financial and
technical resources that are critical to the creation of local  
programming
on the arts, culture, social issues, community affairs, and other  
areas of
the public interest.  These Bills will impact the most disenfranchised,
low-income communities that rely on Public Access TV the most.

Hi all,

There is a tech meetup in NYC and it is quite nice.  Lots of nerdy
discussions and announcements of JOBS from local techs.  Its my first  
meetup
and for an hour it reminded me of an ITP hangout.  Last week we  
talked about
how technology can respond better to diasters.  Anyway... Sign up here.
http://newtech.meetup.com/1/

They are also having a member drive, with some free giveaways... and  
that is
limping along.  Sign up!


Your Organizer, Scott Heiferman, sent the following message to
the members of NY Tech Meetup:

Folks, the 3-Day Member Drive has kinda sucked. There's only
been about a dozen new members. It's OK, the NY Tech Meetup is
still great. I promised that we'd give away a couple of iPod
Nanos, and I've got to honor that, so this means that there are
DECENT ODDS THAT YOU'D WIN. It's the Final Hour of the Member
Drive... Email friends NOW.  Details at

there are a lot of shareware and cheapware utilities that can output  
straight to swf.  look on tucows/versiontracker, or just google.

also, you can bring mov/mpeg files into flash, you don't *need*  
something that goes straight to swf.

One thing to consider if your going to be sending lots of SMS, is to  
work with an aggregator- a virtual operator that has a direct link to  
all mobile operators and their gateways. This is a growing business  
model in the UK, where the big operators (Voda, 02, T-Mobile, 3) sell  
off their 'bandwidth' and services to other companies. Virgin Mobile  
is a prime example of this, as they dont own any network components,  
just lease time from T-Mobile.

What Daniel describes is not an SMS Gateway, just a single point on a  
single operators network. A gateway would provide you with hundreds  
or thousands of ways to send/receive anything to all network  
operators- if you so choose.
I have come across several web solutions, problem is they often SPAM  
the numbers you enter into 'their' database for your use.

Get a phone with the option to send to multiple people and the right  
tariff and do it yourself. (unless this is a weekly thing your doing...)

peace,fleeta

> What Daniel describes is not an SMS Gateway, just a single point

fleeta, Kannel, which is what I am using, is an SMS/WAP gateway by  
definition.  i suspect you might be confusing terminology (SMS vs  
SMSC or simply have a different concept of what you consider a  
gateway.)  regardless, for myself and many on the list i doubt their  
early stage development projects require a large scale operation with  
so many SMSC's.

the good news is i have yet to find a providers device which i can't  
send to.  for this i can probably thank the stringent requirements of  
the shortcode group.  i also have rules to take into account a  
callers country code.

certainly, having only one SMSC defined, as i do, will not give you  
the redundancy and QoS that you describe.  a more traditional, and  
professional, SMS gateway service provider would contain multiple  
pathways to the mobile carrier network.  the good news is that one  
does have the option, within Kannel, to do this them-self too!!   
alternate paths/rules for messages to take is quite easy to define  
simply by setting up multiple SMSC links and SMSCID tags.

for example, within kannel.conf you could have a definition for (a)  
an external SMSC provider/resender like clickatell (which itself is  
likely running kannel in some variant), (b) an SMSC provider that's  
connected via a USB GSM modem bank, (c) an SMSC provider that's  
hooked up via your bluetooth cell, etc, etc.  each could be defined  
in all sorts of different ways working together or separately.

as for sending emails, first of all it depends what is in them *but*  
you really do not need to know a callers cellphone provider to send  
them an email if you have kannel setup, you would need to know their  
country code however.

on the topic of clickatell, i would not suggest them.  i found their  
service is routinely down and when it is you will have fun contacting  
them to get an answer/refund...it took me days to get through to them  
on the phone each time I called!  not to mention adding funds was a  
nightmare, it took days to process a simple order.

i was inspired by all the poor quality SMS gateway providers I ran  
into, and I have used over a dozen, to take matters into my own  
hands.  considering how cheap and easy it is to do yourself it's well  
worth it.  for most simple setups kannel certainly doesn't require a  
dedicated machine.

here's some great documentation worth reading that explains a lot of  
this stuff:
http://kannel.org/download/1.4.0/userguide-1.4.0/userguide.html

I maybe confusing terminology- I am not even sure what a SMSC is?

I agree, a roll-it-your own operation is definitely the way to go for  
most folks- we used a linux box for our shows (texterritory.com).  
But, I was told by the phone operators here, that an SMS GAteway  
provided access to all the mobile operators nets at a rate of  
thousands of SMS every 5 sec or so. As opposed to 1 every 2-3 sec  
with the roll-your-own solution- as you only have 1 SIM card and 1  
point of access to a single operator. And we all know how reliable  
they can be... If one needs to send out thousands of time sensitive  
SMS', there is no other way, is there?

Thanks for the post, I will look into this Kannel.

peace,fleeta

WORST VIRUS EVER --- CNN ANNOUNCED

A new virus has just been discovered that has been classified by  
Microsoft as the most destructive ever. This virus was discovered  
yesterday afternoon by McAfee . This virus simply destroys Sector  
Zero from the hard disk, where vital information for its functioning  
is stored. This virus acts in the following manner:
It sends itself automatically to all contacts on your list with the  
title: "A Card for You".

As soon as the supposed virtual card is opened the computer freezes  
so that the user has to reboot. When the ctrl+alt+del keys or the  
reset button are pressed, the virus destroys Sector Zero, thus  
permanently destroying the hard disk. Yesterday in just a few hours  
this virus caused panic in New York, according to news broadcast by  
CNN. This alert was received by an employee of Microsoft itself.
So don't open any mails with subject: "A Virtual Card for You. " As

Hmm, if you really want to create a malevolent virus, why not develop  
one that's been identified as a hoax and take advantage of people's  
lowered defenses that way?

Subject: VON (the VoIP industry trade show)
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Today is the last day one can signup for a free Expo pass for VON  
(the VoIP industry trade show) with this priority code from  
Primedia's Telephony magazine: TY4
That code also gets you a discounted price on the other packages  
being offered.

The free, exhibits only, pass will get you access to the expo hall  
and all the keynotes, more info here:
https://secure.pulver.com/von/register.html

The conference schedule looks pretty interesting (if you're into this  
stuff -- quite a few appear to be offered as future podcasts):
http://von.com/schedule.html

If anyone here on the list is going to be in Boston (this Mon-Thurs),  
for this or some other reason, perhaps we can try to meetup and  
dorkout on VoIP.

All the best, Daniel

I maybe confusing terminology- I am not even sure what a SMSC is?

an SMSC is your carrier provider.

But, I was told by the phone operators here, that an SMS GAteway
provided access to all the mobile operators nets at a rate of
thousands of SMS every 5 sec or so. As opposed to 1 every 2-3 sec
with the roll-your-own solution

i would do research into what a company trying to sell you their  
service tells you is and is not possible.  SMS resenders are also  
notoriously scummy.  i felt like taking an acid bath after dealing  
with them (the first red flag went up for me when i determined that  
as a business they are classified as a high-risk by credit lenders.)  

kannel can handle huge amounts of traffic, one of the things that  
initially concerned me about using it was just how many thousands of  
messages it can send out in a few seconds if you misconfigure.   
kannel is a proper WAP/SMS implementation, not some 'roll your own'  
hack.  i can't think of a product that comes even close to its  
feature set that doesn't cost thousands of dollars (and/or isn't  
based off of it.)

to give you a sense of its implementations NowSMS bases their product  
on it.  kannel is also the backend to many professional solution  
integrations (including clickatell, etc)  one might look into what  
companies like google and yahoo are using.  i wouldn't be surprised  
if it was a modified version of kannel.

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

I always suggest my customers to just get iron on transfers from
staples (they work very well surprisingly) for short runs. It is
possible to do 1-2 shirts silk screened but you will have to pay for
the set up which run about $25-30 screen per color per location (e.g.
a 2 color font and 3 color back print will be 5 screens x $25.

Subject: Loft Available/Wanted
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

 From a friend: 
 
Brooklyn loft/event space wanted for rent+ NJ loft sublet

Please help! Trying to find a live/work loft/event space in Brooklyn  
& sublet one in Jersey City. Would love to trade for difference in  
price.

LOFT AVAILABLE:
Huge 2-bedroom loft with "art/music studio" designation on the lease,  
above a shop on Hoboken Ave in Jersey City, a block from the tunnel  
and 10-min walk from Journal sq PATH. It is a perfect live/work  
setup, as the main area is frankly gigantic (don't know the square  
footage, but definitely above 1,000) with very high ceilings, and the  
zoning is industrial rather than residential (noise OK). The bedrooms  
are decent-sized (can fit queen-size bed, dressers, etc). Large  
closet. Separate "broom closet"/workroom with slop sink. Nice cozy  
bathroom. Kitchen is part of main loft area. Large windows. Own  
thermostat. Roof access (the only one in the building). Everything  
solid, just needs a coat of paint, if desired. Living room already  
has couch set, for the next few months, at least.

This is the most perfect artist share I've seen. $1700. Open Oct 1,  
please move on this ASAP.

The apartment was left to me by a friend who's moved and wanted it to  
remain with someone she knows. Please be understanding of the sublet  
arrangement. Artists/musicians preferred. Will require first/last  
month's rent + 1/2 month security.


LOFT WANTED:
Trying to find a miracle of a space to create something amazing in an  
area I've grown to love (Prospect Heights, Brooklyn). I want to run a  
local event space, one that would have good atmosphere and fun  
parties and art from local artists. No thumping techno, but great  
live music. Yoga and dance classes. I want to make my living room the  
community's arts center and a great location for private parties.

Looking for about 2000 sq ft at $1/sq ft or under, live/work, with a  
sympatehtic landlord who would understand what I'm trying to do and  
possibly give a break on the rent for the first 1-2 months to rebuild  
into something beautiful. Must have roof access or backyard, 2 exits  
a plus. Storefront w/apt above also possibility. Would prefer direct/ 
no fee. This is the kind of space that revitalizes a neighborhood.  
Please help!

Pretty simple.  They can seperate colors easily with an .ai file,  
which most print companies take (contact them, as they may take  
ooooold versions of .ai's only).

I suggest making a layer which has the intended shirt color on it,  
design with that in the background, and then either remove, or post a  
message in the layer to remove before printing.  Otherwise, if you're  
doing multiple spot colors, just use your swatch to designate them  
and the printer can do a match from that.

If it's going to be done as a screen print rather than plastisol
transfer, sublimation etc. you have to keep in mind that super thin
lines in a design will have to be fattened up or they will not print
well (break up etc.).

Also, keep in mind that colos print differently on fabric than paper
so make sure even if you give PMS colors eveyryone is clear on the
acutal print color you want as the end result. If you can see a
pre-production sample it's best (probably will be charged $20-75 for
it)  and if you want to avoid the charge for a pre-production sample
tell them you want to be there the day of the printing to be able to
approve the colors.

What follows is my suggestion for a NY area, professional silkscreen  
operator.  My experience dates back to 2001...so...keep that in mind.

Once upon a time, I needed to mass-transfer a silkscreen onto  
tshirts.  I asked some friends who own, and operate, clothing shops  
downtown where they turn for production.  Somewhat surprisingly I got  
the same answer from everyone: Pro Graphix in Long Island City.

My order was simple and it probably made it all the easier for them  
to do a great job.  If you visit in person you'll probably find that  
their plant is rather impressive technologically.  I am not sure what  
they offer these days but I appreciated that they can poly bag each  
shirt individually (and add tags/labels if you have them made up  
elsewhere.)  If you're looking for time with a "designer" who looks  
over your art you're not gonna get it without paying but you can  
email your documents and get immediate feedback.  They made it clear  
to me that they don't want to print bad shirts/tshirts/sweatshirts/ 
etc which make them look bad.

Their inventory was very familiar looking -- it's sort of a who's who  
of skatewear labels and major recording artists who are going on mega- 
monster-tours.  I guess what I'm saying is don't expect the royal  
treatment if you hit them up with a 100< tshirt order.  They will do  
a great job but I think they are really after the 1000+ order.

I was very happy with the turn around time, results, and price.  So  
far, the folks I suggested have also been happy with the results.   
It's been awhile but here's the information from my Address Book, not  
sure which info/name is more accurate but it's definitely pointing to  
the same place.

Pro Graphix
718-937-2020
prographix@qwest.net

Art-Fx
Richard DiBarnardo
30-40 41st Ave.
Long Island City, New York 11101
artfxink@aol.com

Because they are industry oriented, they tend to ask immediately  
where you got their name/info, feel free to drop my name.  I can't  
say it will get you anywhere but it will certainly answer the question.

Regards, Daniel Raffel

Oh. also....

Some of you may not know that there is an ITP Video List.

It's pretty low traffic, but, if you have a video question and need  
an answer you'll get a response pretty quickly.

So ...

Subject: 2 Questions
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hi List,

1) Does anyone have experience with using this software called  
Bookminder?
   It's a database program for booksellers that's written in  
Filemaker Pro.

2) Can anyone recommend a super techie who is comfortable with both Mac
and PC platforms to work with an elderly and somewhat eccentric man?
Need to help him transfer a bunch of files from a Win XP machine over  
to a
new Powerbook.  This person should have infinite patience and know  
exactly
what he's doing.  I said "he" because it's better if this techie is a  
male
for various reasons...
Please forward me names and rates off list.


Much thanks!
Cindy

a pirate walks into a bar, with a steering wheel attached in a  
somewhat complicated fashion to his lower torso and hips.  it looks  
particularly uncomfortable, and the pirate winces as he sits on the  
bar stool.

'what's the deal with the steering wheel?' asks one of the barflys.

the pirate replies, 'aarrrrrrrr, it's driving me nuts.'

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

I'm (still) looking for a roommate - 750 per month and you get two of  
your very own rooms on your very own floor! :-) Available  
immediately. On City Island: Check out www.cityisland.com. It's a tad  
of a hike from ITP but I did the commute myself some years ago and  
it's 100% doable - and City Island is like no other place, more like  
New England than NYC. The commute was about 50 minutes door to door.

It's a large, beautiful, Victorian-style house in a very safe and  
extremely friendly neighborhood (sailing, swimming, kayaking,  
restaurants, galleries). Lots of light, beautiful hard-wood floors.  
I'm a 34-year-old, ex-ITP, European female. I don't smoke, please  
don't either. 

- Own living room and bedroom on the third floor
- Dishwasher, washer & dryer, big backyard.
- Private beach
- Parking always easy to find
- wireless internet and cable TV
- Shared large eat-in kitchen and a huge bathroom
- 7-minute bus ride from # 6 subway; 5-minute drive from 95 (Exit 8B)  
and Hutchinson; 20-minute drive to White Plains; 10 minutes to New  
Rochelle etc.

If you know of someone interested let them know to call Veera:

VR Goggles Heal Scars of War
From: Wired News - 08/22/2005
By: Xeni Jardin

An experimental virtual-reality system that vividly replicates combat  
trauma
is being used to treat soldiers suffering from shellshock. The  
Institute for
Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California  
developed the
system last year with the U.S. Office of Naval Research. Cmdr. Russell
Shilling with the Office of Naval Research says the project is novel  
in that
it attempts to treat post-traumatic stress disorder early, rather  
than years,
sometimes decades, after the trauma. The patient wears headphones and VR
goggles, while a clinician uses a control tablet to choose from an  
array of
artificial environments and enhance them with stress-inducing audio and
visual effects that can be dialed up or down according to how  
patients react
physiologically. Institute for Creative Technologies virtual therapy
developer Dr. Albert Rizzo says odors will be added to the mix with a  
device
that generates smells. Dr. James Spira with the San Diego Medical  
Center's
Health Psychology Program says VR's appeal as a therapeutic tool lies  
in its
ability to reproduce a trauma's full sensory input, and adds that the  
new
system is more effective as a healing aid than any other tool he has  
used.
Backers of VR therapy experiments hope that part of a $1.5 billion  
increase
in veterans' health care funding authorized by Congress in July will be
committed to the development of similar technologies.

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hey List,
I think I'm going to be Jewish at least one day this year and that of  
course would be on PURIM!  Ha, ha.  Seriously though, I want  
to attend a Yom Kippur service either in Manhattan or Brooklyn, but  
I have no idea what temple to check out. We're actually thinking long  
term as one day we may even join a temple.  I think we're looking for  
something in the Conservative or Reform movements that isn't too  
formal, but not hippy-dippy either.  We want it to be progressive  
and tolerant but also traditional.  It would be great too if the  
the sermons were philosophical and intellectual.  Anybody have  
something to suggest?
Thanks,
Lisa

I've been to Beth Simchat Torah a few times. They have an open door
policy for the High Holidays- everyone is welcome.

http://www.cbst.org/

While It's the largest gay/lesbian/bi/transgender friendly synagogue
in the world the High Holidays have a huge turnout and it's a mixed
and welcoming crowd.  Crowd is the operative so if you want a small,
warm, fuzzy place to go you might do better in a smaller place.  They
typically hold Yom Kippur services at Javits Center because it gets
such high attendance because of the open-door policy. This year
services will be held elsewhere.

follow up, by open door it means it's free. you don't need to be a
member nor do you need tickets to attend but you should pre-register
on the website.

it's time for another round of the ITP List's favorite posting: what

week.  total spur of the moment.  i don't know anything, and i don't  
have time to read up, and i don't know a word of spanish.  stupid,  
but that's how it goes.  i promised a friend i would take a trip with

so he called me and said "guess what, we're going to cuba."  any  
advice or recommendations welcome.  we're going through Nassau btw.   
i think we are willing to do some adventuring, but would like a fair

we won't be stingy if it will make things easier.

it has also been widely noted that cuba is way ahead of us as far as
storm preparedness...

in any case, a week is pretty tight for cuba (for anywhere really).
havana is cool but it would be great to get out to the countryside.
Vinales is absolutely gorgeous, great for hikes / bike rentals. if you
can afford it, it wouldn't be a bad idea to rent a car. from vinales
you can get to some beautiful pristine remote beaches. but you'll need
to rent the car in havana.

make sure you bring an extra large wad of cash. your american cards
will not work in cuba. it's part of the economic embargo. and cuba is
not cheap. i would bring 700 or 800 dollars in cash to be safe. make
sure to budget for your final taxi to the airport and the exit tax
when you leave the country.

Another piece of news which might put a bumper to your spontaneous

Cuba no longer accept US dollars. Fidel said so. I remember hearing  
it in the news.
I did a search for you just to make sure it is still the case. It is.
http://www.acrosscuba.com/index.php?L=3&B=35

So make sure to get Euros (Euros are most welcome there).

This isn't exactly true. I was there in January after the currency
shift. What it means in practice is that they don't widely accept
dollars for normal everyday transactions in the streets and hotels and
casas particulares. But they will change your dollars for
"convertibles," the new currency which is fixed to the dollar, at the
airport and banks, with a commission. The reason Cubans won't accept
dollars is that they don't want to have to pay the commission fee for
conversion. But if you offer to pay some percentage over the cost to
cover the commission they will likely accept your dollars, especially
if it means going elsewhere with your business.

According to the article, this was only enforced after April this year.
I wonder how much pressure was put on the population to conform.
All things considered, it may be worthwhile doing the exchange to  
Euros not getting the 10% penalty.

Anyway you would know better than me since I haven't been.
Eric will be able to tell us upon his return.

be very careful about getting in and out of the country and about not  
letting the US authorities catch on when you get back. the laws  
governing americans visiting cuba are really strict, and it is  
possible to end up with huge fines and even jail time for spending  
any money there. i was there a few years back, with legal travel  
papers and still had some difficulties. unfortunately, i didn't get  
out much while i was there, so i don't have a lot of recommendations  
for you. best of luck and have a safe and fun trip!

veradero is arguably the most beatiful beach in the world.
unfortunately it is closed off to cubans unless they work for the
resorts.  it was not expensive at all.  i probably spent a little too
much time in havana, which wasn't that exciting.  it is fun to hang
out on the malecon and talk to cubans.

re: money.
I think between the time you spend working out exchange rates between  
us dollars, euros, canadian dollars, etc, you don't end up saving too  
much if you change your money here in the US before going to cuba.  
You can still exchange us dollars there, its just that you can no  
longer use dollars in stores, etc., and you need to pay the penalty.
There are Cadecas (money exchange places) all over havana. If you  
don't want to travel with "huge wad of cash" as I think some one else  
suggested, you can get a transcard:
(http://www.smart-transfer.com/) which works at atms all over havana,  
and I assume, in most of the countryside.

In Havana, you should get outside of Habana Vieja, which is, of  
course, well worth seeing, but is just a tiny piece of the picture.
I recommend walking around the neighborhoods of Vedado (there is a  
nice bookstore at UNEAC), and also Cerro, and also Centro Habana.
It is nice to take the little and very short ferry ride from habana  
vieja to the area of Regla. Ferry also goes to Casa Blanca, another  
nice place to walk around, and go up to the Cristo on the hill there  
for a nice view of the harbor and all of habana.
A good place for a drink (with great view) is from the restaurant on  
top of the Focsa building (can't remember its name).
A good place for a coffee, if you are tired of pounding the pavement  
and want a break, is the patio at the hotel nacional.
For a beach with a good popular feel, Santa Maria, in playas del este.
For less people (ie, restricted access to the locals -- which is a  
common thing in cuba), the playa grande in Tarara is very nice too.
But these are not resort-y at all. I can't offer advice re:  that.

The cuban collection at the Bellas Artes museum is really terrific  
(the museum is in two different buildings, and I am talking about the  
modern one), and I highly recommmend spending time there -- start at  
the top with the 16th century maps...and it goes up to contemporary  
cuban artists.
the Museo Wilfredo Lam is a lovely spot, and often has interesting  
shows up. Ditto re: Centro de Artes Visuales (not exactly its name,  
but something like that, on la plaza vieja, in habana vieja,  across  
from the Fototeca, which sometimes has good things on as well).
Centro Pablo de la Torriente Brau often has music on saturday  
afternoons -- folksy, nueva trova. Its a scene.
In the parque almendares (which is alongside the little river that  
cuts through habana) is an amphitheatre where they sometimes have  
very good music shows, and all sorts of people show up and play.  
entry is in pesos, and is very low. Ask around to see if anything is  
going on there while you are there.
Also, see what is on at the little bar atop the auditorio national --  
they sometimes have good music, and it is a small space, not too  
touristy.

Walk along the Malecon. Sit along the Malecon. late afternoon.

I have a friend who rents out a nice small apt. on the line between  
centro habana and habana vieja if you are looking for a place to stay.

Someone else wrote about being careful re: breaking US law by going  
to Cuba, and you should heed that advice. Bush admin is really  
cracking down on unauthorized travel (and at the same time really  
limiting even further who it authorizes to travel). No one is doing  
jail time for going (though the penalties as written are something  
like: up to 250,000 in fines and up to ten years in jail), but  
typical fines range from 800 to 8000.
Don't bring anything back with you, no matter how much you want to  
give your best friend cigars, etc. This includes your tourist guide  
books, etc.

Lastly, I am sad to write that havana, which used to be very very  
safe, has gotton less so in last couple of years. You need to be  
really careful with your camera, your wallet, etc. This used to be  
only in tourist areas, but now it is everywhere. Dont carry all your  
money in one place, etc., etc. Also, be wary of going off to a party  
or something with people you don't know.
That said, there are mostly great people there, its just they aren't  
the ones hanging out at bars where the tourists go...If you or your  
friend speak spanish, that will  help a lot.

Its a really interesting place. Hope you have a good time.

Sadly enough...i am not just legal tender but i am legal and tender

don't spend me all in one place


For one week in Cuba - Havana is almost enough - the bus out to the  
beach is super cheap tho and u can get a cab back

Havana is pretty big so u can walk around and never cross your path

there are some touristy areas but they are easy to avoid

I would say just explore as much as u can

have a great time

Peace

Yeah the Holoubek can be exchanged, you just have to be sure to  
negotiate the rate of exchange up front if it's not posted. If you  
make a purchase with Holoubeks and make sure they give you back the  
right amount of change. Sometimes they try to rush you hoping to  
finish the transaction before you've had time to calculate the exact  
rate of exchange.

The black market rate is often better than what they'll give you at  
hotels or at the airport, but you may incur a legal penalty if you  
are caught trading them illegally. There are also penalties for  
returning to the United States with more than the legal limit if you  
try to bring them back to give to your friends.

I still have Holoubeks leftover from a recent vacation, but I have  
not been able to find a dealer or collector in the US willing to  
exchange them for cash. Maybe I can sell them on Craig's List or EBay?

 From my Cuban Friend

My advice is:

be street-wise in a new york way. As an
American in Havana you will be preyed upon by
"jineteras" and "jineteros" (pronounced
hee-net-air-uh). They're like hookers, but they don't
just have sex for money, they'll also hang out with
you and keep you company (i.e., they'll be your
friend/guide) in exchange for you buying them meals,
drinks, clothing, etc. etc. Don't trust them. They
make up stories about their lives in order to
entertain and are more than willing to take you on
tours of havana. These tours consist of visiting all
the restaurant/bar hangouts of their hustler friends
(Montserrat is a popular one) where you will be
propositioned by even more jineteras. Especially be
aware of getting into a cab with one or of getting
into any cab where the driver has a person sitting
next to them in the passenger's side. Tourists do get
assaulted there, especially the American ones, and you
don't want to get in trouble with Cuban authorities.

That's the big WARNING. Be smart about which Cubans
you engage with. They will all be friendly, but some
will want your money. The way they proposition you is
sometimes very subtle.

Havana is gorgeous. The museums there are wonderful--I
recommend them all.

Beaches:
Varadero is tops, really the most beautiful
beach I"ve ever seen. It's a few hours from Havana. If
you can rent a car and drive there yourself it might
be best. There are other ways of getting there, such
as tours, taxis, etc. Just make sure if you ask
someone how to get there that you ask a hotel worker
or someone respectable. There are tourists in Varadero
and there are Jineteras, but you'll hardly get
harrassed, if at all.

Eating:
Try out the various Paladares (pronounced
Paula-dah-ris or, singular: Paula-dar). They are
privately owned places to eat, usually in people's
homes. Some are fancier and more expensive than
others, but if you want to eat more than the fried
chicken and ham/cheese sandwiches that you find
everywhere else, try these.

Enjoy yourself. People will be very friendly, and you
can be friendly back. If someone tries to sell you
something, you can say no and it'll be okay. Lots of
Cubans speak English, esp. in Havana.

Guanabo is a popular

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

I'm interested in learning conversation Mandarin.  I don't want the  
audio
lingual approach
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_language_teaching) nor do
I want a teacher who goes back and forth between Chinese and English.

I'm registered/taking a class at The New School but after the first
class I realize I really do want a different approach. I'm bascially
trying to find a Chinese course or Chinese teacher who uses a
Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach similar to the Aliance
Francaise approach to teaching French or immersive ESL courses (e.g.
RSA ESL approach).

Thanks!

all I know but here are a couple of other options.

China Institute
http://www.chinainstitute.org/classes/language.html

Wossing Center for Chinese (in Chinatown)
http://www.wossing.com/

also, NYU school of continuing ed offers Mandarin classes.
definitely a useful language to know...

Since my eldest child is now in college majoring in Chinese, having  
studied Mandarin all through high school, and his little sister has  
been "studying" Mandarin as well via the China Institute and private  
tutors,  I have a little experience with this.

Serious students of Chinese insist that the most important quality in  
a teacher is his or her accent. You may not agree, but there really  
is a nationally acknowledged "standard" accent which all Mandarin  
speakers respect, even those from areas with rather different  
sounding dialects. Typically, you will want someone with an educated  
native Beijing accent; the sort you hear on CCTV. As I write this,  
I'm conscious that it smacks of all sorts of elitist and class  
issues. I can only add that the Chinese maintain the same in reverse  
--  English speakers looking to teach English in China are prized if  
they are educated native speakers without regional accents.

 From your description of the methodology you seek, it sounds as if  
you would like the China Institute's approach. Real immersion is  
hugely successful with Chinese. For what it's worth the China  
Institute has a serious immersion program in the summer here in the  
city and there are numbers of other programs in China.

My son couldn't do without Wenlin or his trusty wipe off marker slate  
-- those things on your dorm room door in college, but these may not  
be useful right away.

Excellent goal. Good luck.

Researchers Build World's Smallest Mobile Robot


Dartmouth -- In a world where "supersize" has entered the lexicon,  
there are some things getting smaller, like cell phones and laptops.  
Dartmouth researchers have contributed to the miniaturizing trend by  
creating the world's smallest untethered, controllable robot.

Their extremely tiny machine is about as wide as a strand of human  
hair, and half the length of the period at the end of this sentence.  
About 200 of these could march in a line across the top of a plain M&M.

The researchers, led by Bruce Donald, the Joan P. and Edward J. Foley  
Jr. 1933 Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth, report their  
creation in a paper that will be presented at the 12th International  
Symposium of Robotics Research in October in San Francisco, which is  
sponsored by the International Federation of Robotics Research.

A longer, more detailed paper about this microrobot will also appear  
in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Microelectromechanical  
Systems, a publication of the IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and  
Electronics Engineers.

"It's tens of times smaller in length, and thousands of times smaller  
in mass than previous untethered microrobots that are controllable,"  
says Donald. "When we say 'controllable,' it means it's like a car;  
you can steer it anywhere on a flat surface, and drive it wherever  
you want to go. It doesn't drive on wheels, but crawls like a silicon  
inchworm, making tens of thousands of 10-nanometer steps every  
second. It turns by putting a silicon 'foot' out and pivoting like a  
motorcyclist skidding around a tight turn."

The future applications for micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS,  
include ensuring information security, such as assisting with network  
authentication and authorization; inspecting and making repairs to an  
integrated circuit; exploring hazardous environments, perhaps after a  
hazardous chemical explosion; or involving biotechnology, say to  
manipulate cells or tissues.

Donald worked with Christopher Levey, Assistant Professor of  
Engineering and the Director of the Microengineering Laboratory at  
Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth Ph.D. students  
Craig McGray and Igor Paprotny, and Daniela Rus, Associate Professor  
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology.

Their paper describes a machine that measures 60 micrometers by 250  
micrometers (one micrometer is one thousandth of a millimeter). It  
integrates power delivery, locomotion, communication, and a  
controllable steering system - the combination of which has never  
been achieved before in a machine this small. Donald explains that  
this discovery ushers in a new generation of even tinier microrobots.

cells. (Courtesy Donald Laboratory)

McGray, who earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science working on this  
project in Donald's lab, adds, "Machines this small tend to stick to  
everything they touch, the way the sand sticks to your feet after a  
day at the beach.

So we built these microrobots without any wheels or hinged joints,  
which must slide smoothly on their bearings. Instead, these robots  
move by bending their bodies like caterpillars. At very small scales,  
this machine is surprisingly fast." McGray is currently a researcher  
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in  
Gaithersburg, Md.

The prototype is steerable and untethered, meaning that it can move  
freely on a surface without the wires or rails that constrained the  
motion of previously developed microrobots. Donald explains that this  
is the smallest robot that transduces force, is untethered, and is  
engaged in its own locomotion.

The robot contains two independent microactuators, one for forward  
motion and one for turning. It's not pre-programmed to move; it is  
teleoperated, powered by the grid of electrodes it walks on. The  
charge in the electrodes not only provides power, it also supplies  
the robot's instructions that allow it to move freely over the  
electrodes, unattached to them.

The work was funded in part by the Department of Homeland Security,  
Office of Domestic Preparedness through Dartmouth's Institute for  
Security Technology Studies (ISTS).

pretty cool.  even cooler, it was funded by the dept of homeland

i dunno bout the former, but maybe the latter refers to cleaning up  
spills and pet accidents?  now THAT's technology.

great, it's bad enough that poop is crawling with nano-insects (and  
some not-so-nano cockroaches), but now we'll have to watch out for  
tiny poop-infesting nanomachines courtesy of the dep. of homeland

Hey Culturebots-

I've got a Special Culturebot Ticket Offer for Opening Weekend of  
PASTORALIA!

Yehuda Duenyas has adapted George Saunders's novella "Pastoralia" for  
the stage.

"Pastoralia" is a darkly comic story of Ed and Janet, live-in  
employees at a historically-themed amusement park where they simulate  
the day-to-day life of early humans in a display cave dwelling: they  
roast goats, draw pictographs, and grunt at one other. The park has  
fallen on hard times; as a result, layoffs threaten Ed and Janet's  
jobs. In this hilarious, heartbreaking tale, Ed and Janet are put to  
the test and ultimately must choose between their families'  
livelihoods and their own dignity.

We are making a limited number of FREE tickets to opening night  
available for Culturebots. Opening night is Wednesday, September  
21st. Showtime is 8:30 p.m. Can't make it on Wednesday? Culturebots  
can get $10 tickets to "Pastoralia" all weekend long! Use the same  
code and get $10 for Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sundays  
performances. Oh yeah, the code word is "cavebot".

For more info:
http://www.ps122.org/performances/pastoralia.html

To get tickets email Olivia at Olivia@ps122.org

Also, of course, a reminder - part of the Culturebot mission is to  
increase the discussion of the arts on the interweb. If you have a  
blog PLEASE PLEASE write about the shows you see!!! If you don't have  
a blog, get one. Everybody's doing it.

Love,
Andy, your Culturebot editor

a few ITP people involved!


We wanted to invite you to Definition, a three-part installation  
involving two video projections alongside an interactive audio- 
graphic physical computing piece.

Commissioned by the Jewish Museum, NY, for an exhibition entitled  
"The Jewish Identity Project" opening September 20th, 2005,  
Definition is a representation of the multiplicity of definitions of  
the term "Jewish" as viewed by individuals both Jewish and non- 
Jewish. The metaphor of a sign-language "dictionary" serves as a  
formal access point, in which a vocabulary of invented and  
choreographed physical gestures is enacted in diverse indoors and  
outdoor urban locales by a group of actors/dancers.

Produced and directed by Tirtza Even and Brian Karl
Choreography: Melinda Ring
Programming: Luke DuBois, Scott Fitzgerald, Todd Holoubek.

Manhattan Cultural Council
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hello y'all...

I've been lucky enough to curate a little show at the Lower Manhattan  
Cultural Council's new gallery "redhead" in Maiden Lane.  Opens Sept.  
29th, come or perish!!

Jamie


Press Release

WOOD METAL WATER
redhead gallery
125 Maiden Lane
Sept. 29th - Nov. 5th
Opening Sept. 29
www.lmcc.net/woodmetalwater

Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s presents “Wood Metal Water”,  
the inaugural show of their new exhibition space,  
“redhead.”  Curated by Jamie Allen, guest curator, the exhibition  
features an international group of artists working with new media and  
physical sculpture in novel ways.

The meandering of vibrating anthropomorphisms, electronically  
assisted shrubbery, interactive heavy-metal furniture, ceiling bound  
kinetic figures, a cavitating columnar water fountain, sub-sonic  
sound sculpture, a water video-fall and oversized graphite plumbs are  
some of the elements you can expect to see at Wood Metal Water.

The raw material constituents of practically all fabrication - the  
tension and music within everything we live in, eat off or sit on -  
serve as inspiration for works that point to the pregnant potential  
offered in cycles of destruction and reconstruction.  High-amplitude,  
low-frequency selected artworks from a crew of unapologetically  
multifaceted and corporeal artists.

Artists Ian Curry, Paul Davies, Jeff Degolier, Hendrik Gerrits, Tom  
Kotik, Eunjoo Shin and Meghan Trainor intercede in both the lobby and  
gallery in the Financial District space at 125 Maiden Lane.  Opening  
night on September 29th features aural performance work by Daniel  
Perlin, starting at 7pm.


gallery hours: Sept 29 – Nov 5 M-F 10 am - 7 pm

Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC) is the leading voice for arts  
and culture in downtown New York City, producing cultural events and  
promoting the arts through grants, services, advocacy, and cultural  
development programs.

FIRSTHIRD WORLD
A BENEFIT FOR THE SURVIVORS OF HURRICANE KATRINA
Sunday, September 25. 6-10PM

@ Galapagos  Art Space
70 North 6th Street
between Kent and Wythe
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY 11211

minimum $5 donation + 1 drink

HOSTED BY REGIE CABICO
INSTALLATION BY SIDDHARTHA JOAG


WORDS + IMAGES by

MARK PAPALLERO
ANGEL VELASCO SHAW
BEAU SIA
OMAR TELAN
KELLY TSAI
And many more…


Description:

Regie Cabico and Siddhartha Joag, present an evening of New York City's
progressive and political artists sharing their work to support the  
Asian
American populations displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Performers include
poets Edward Garcia, Gamal Chasten (of UniVerses), Fay Chiang, Beau Sia,
Omar Telan, Kelly Tsai and many more. Also featured will be visual  
work of
Jason DaSilva, Fay Chiang, Angel Shaw, and Mark Papaellero and a site
specific installation and performance by Siddhartha Joag and Regie  
Cabico.

The goal of this event is to express our solidarity with the people  
of the
Gulf Coast in this time of crisis by collaborating and creating analytic
work that contextualizes the Bush administrations’ response to Katrina
within the larger framework of corporate globalization, neo-imperialism,
empire, war & the immutable facism that is growing from the cracks of  
U.S.
democracy and capitalism. The lesson of Katrina is there exists a third
world people within the United States who despite their citizenship  
are no
less expendable to the ruling class than the over 500,000 Iraqi children
murdered by the U.S. in the past decade.  In times of crisis it is  
easy to
fall in the trap of immediate hysteria and nationalist thinking, we hope
this show reminds people that we need to always think globally,
collectively and creatively in order to affect real sustainable social
change.

“Firsthird World” is the second event in an ongoing series of
multidisciplinary collaborations between artists of color creating work
around contemporary social and political issues.

Directions to Galapagos:

 From Manhattan by Subway- Take the L to Bedford Ave. (1st stop in
Brooklyn), exit on N. 7th and walk down one block to N. 6th, take a  
right
and walk 2 1/2 blocks over. We're between Wythe and Kent on the left  
side.
Or Take the JMZ to Marcy Ave. Walk two blocks west on Broadway to  
Bedford
Ave. Catch the B61 bus and take it to N7 (approximately 5 minute ride).

Subject: JOB: Caricaturist wanted
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hi there,

Fox Reality is looking for a caricaturist that can create caricatures  
of each of the contestants on the top 6 reality shows this Fall  
(Survivor, Apprentice, ANTM, Amazing Race, etc).  We're building a  
Fantasy Reality game (ala fantasy football) for our website, but  
don't have the right to use actual photographs of the contestants,  
hence our need for illustrations.

We are located in LA, though it's probably fine if you're not.  This  
is a paid gig.    If you think you fit this bill, we'll need to see  
examples of your work (the caricature, as well as a pic of the person  
you're depicting).  Please send examples to me at alicia.cervini@fox.com

Please also feel free to forward this to your many caricaturist friends.

Thanks all!

Alicia

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

The hardrive in my Powermac G4 desktop is dead or very ill.  I've  
always used Tekserve but Digital Society would be so much more  
convenient.  I vaguely recall that people on the list had problems  
with them.   I have Apple Care so cost should not be an issue.  Does  
anyone have opinions?

Also, I don't know at this point whether all of my data is lost.  
Most, not all, of my stuff was backed up.  The Apple tech support guy  
mentioned Drivesavers.  Anyone use them?

Tekserve charges by the size of the drive for restoring data. It's  
incredibly expensive. They got my stuff back a few years back and I  
needed it desperately, so I was glad they could, but the cost was  
shocking.

No experience with Digital Society or Drivesavers.

Digital society replaced my logic board and battery latch
about a month ago.  They let me know when they had the parts from apple
and I dropped the pb off in the morning and picked it up the next day.

Having problems w/sleep mode, but I think that is a yet to be fixed  
problem.

Subject: Question for all video encoder gurus...
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hi List,

I have an encoding question.

The site I work for is launching a complete broadband
version, and we want to start with streaming up to 200
video clips a day, of varying lengths. The problem is
that, for the moment, due to cost and bandwidth
constraints, we can't encode at too high a bit rate. I
am encoding at 130Kbits or so (max), the window size
is 320 X 240, format is wmv. This serves well for
close up and interviews but not for music videos or
movie trailers.

My questions is: I have seen many sites that stream
great videos and they play well on my connection
(about 300 K). Is there a magic way to make the videos
look great in about 130 K bit rate? I have ordered
cleaner, am encoding in windows media encoder for now.

If there is any other software or setting that I
should be trying, I'd love to know.

Thanks!

Gopika.

This is analogous to shoving a square peg in a round hole.
You get what you encode. There is a tripartite relationship between  
image size - quality - bitrate.
No 2 or 3 ways about it... whether you use Cleaner, Squeeze, WM,  
Real, or Qt. Once you get a formula your happy with, remember it!

I could give you a couple of ideas:
First, encode in higher settings than 130 K (it's just not enough bit  
rate
to give you a high quality video for broadband).
Next, try to encode the highest quality source materiel you can get your
hands on.
Digi-Beta source will give you a much better quality for your encoded
files than lets say mini-DV source.
Use cleaner, it is the better option out there.
Experiment with different encoders. WM10 should be better than WM9, and
for sure it is better than WM8.

Thanks..will try it and see.

I know that 130 K is not good enough but here, in
India, you can't go higher than that if you want many
people to be able to watch it.

Thanks for your input.

Wagamama is an chain of anglo-style asian-fusion food. OK, but if you  
know better then go to the little Malaysian coffee shop off Wardour  
st (in chinatown)- the alley is accessible via the 'Crispy Duck'  
restaruant...

I think this is the only affordable place in town!

Dive bars- not in Paddington! Go over to Brick lane, where you can  
get your fill on Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi food. Plus there  
are many 'hot' pubs and clubs: 93 feet east, Vibe Bar to name my favs.

For japanese- goto Notorama in the Barbican- itself a marvel of urban  
living.

Dont believe the review, they are not a chain- except for their bento  
outlets...

Have fun!

Here are a few of my "dam favorites:

Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum: The Netherlands Maritime Museum is  
housed in the National Naval Depot, a former arsenal of the Dutch  
Navy that is over 300 years old. The unique and superb collection  
tells the story of the maritime past of the Netherlands.

One of my favorite places in Amsterdam. Amazing museum of Dutch  
Maritime history. Many cool artifacts, ships, models and art. My  
specific favorite place in the museum is the exhibit about Jaan van  
Speik, a Dutch naval hero who gave the Dutch the expression "I'd  
rather blow myself up," primarily used in response to dating  
inquiries. Check it out at:  http://www.scheepvaartmuseum.nl/ 
index_ns.htm

Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam: One of the oldest botanic gardens in the  
world. Today, there are more than 6,000 plants (>4,000 species)  
growing in the garden and greenhouses. The Hortus is located in the  
Plantage district on the edge of the hectic center of Amsterdam.  
Behind the 300-year-old gates, however, the bustle of the city seems  
to disappear.

Hortus is cool. Back when the Dutch were exploring and colonizing  
they worked very hard to bring back examples of plants to cultivate  
and profit from at their other colonies. It was hard to get a plant  
from Sumatra to grow in Holland. The ones that they successfully  
managed to convey to and grow in Holland were spread all over the  
world. Interesting. My personal fave is what I like to call "The  
Mother of All Coffee." The first coffee plant brought to Europe was  
cloned and is the source for all the coffee that we drink. A clone of  
the first plant is at Hortus. If you like the coffee, then go visit  
it's ancestor and kowtow to it. http://www.hortus-botanicus.nl/index.asp

the driving force of all Waag Society's activities. The oldest

was built in 1488 as a citygate but in the centuries that followed,  
the building successively served as a weighhouse, guildhall, fire

various guilds that were housed in the building left behind clear  
traces of their occupation. As a result, de Waag contains unique  
examples of brick-laying that include work form the master  
examinations of the members of the brick-layers guild.

In 1691 the guild of chirurgeons added an octagonal domed tower which  
housed the Theatrum Anatomicum. It was here, in this theatre that the  
first Northern European public dissections took place. Rembrandt was  
a regular visitor and immortalised the practice of anatomy in his  
painting 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp'.  http://www.waag.org/

The only other thing that I can say is walk everywhere all the time.  
Amsterdam is beautiful and every neighborhood has great stuff to  
discover. I think that the last time I was there I must have walked  
about 10 miles a day. My feet were killing me, but it's really a  
walking/biking town. Rent a bike! Have a great trip!

Second the Van Gogh.  Also the Rijks, right nearby.

Hey don't forget to hit the coffeeshop first.  Particularly Grey  
Area: Oude Leliestraat 2, multiple winner of the "Cannabis Cup".  Say  
hi to John, the owner.  (Or so I've heard.)  Then go over the canal  
to the place with green stripey awning for excellent homemade apple  
cake.  Or Puccini Bonboni right down the street - I would say 2nd  
best chocolates in the world.

Then keep munching.  Get your rijsttafel on at Tujuh Maret,  
Utrechtsestraat 73.  Thai food at Cook Kai: Tweede Rozendwarsstraat  
3 in the Jordaan.  

Hartog’s Volkorenbakkerij voted best bakery in 'Dam and I can

There's a place on Berenstraat or Runstraat in the Jordaan that also  
is great - they make a wicked sandwich with cream cheese, walnuts and  
honey.

Like Howard said, steer clear of the Red Light District...

The Rijks Museum is under renovations till like 2008 and that means  
that they took the 400 "most popular" paintings (Nightwatch for  
example) and put them on two floors of a wing of the building. That  
is all that is accessible. Sucks because the building itself is so  
cool, as are all of the lesser known parts of the collections. I  
would still recommend going, but it's not the same thing.

design of the information 

society. In this it doesn't let itself be lead by

technology but 

instead looks at the possibilities of people,

their creativity and 

culture. The interplay of technology and culture

is the driving force 

of all Waag Society's activities. The oldest

secular building of 

Amsterdam has a long and varied history. De Waag

was built in 1488 as 

a citygate but in the centuries that followed, the

building 

successively served as a weighhouse, guildhall,

fire station, 

municipal archives and museum for jewish history.

The various guilds 

that were housed in the building left behind clear

traces of their 

occupation. As a result, de Waag contains unique

examples of 

brick-laying that include work form the master

examinations of the 

members of the brick-layers guild.

 In 1691 the guild of chirurgeons added an

octagonal domed tower which 

housed the Theatrum Anatomicum. It was here, in

this theatre that the 

first Northern European public dissections took

place. Rembrandt was a 

regular visitor and immortalised the practice of

anatomy in his 

painting 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp'.

 The only other thing that I can say is walk

everywhere all the time. 

Amsterdam is beautiful and every neighborhood has

great stuff to 

discover. I think that the last time I was there I

must have walked 

about 10 miles a day. My feet were killing me, but

it's really a 

walking/biking town. Rent a bike! Have a great

trip!

Dear Luis,

Just came back from AMS a couple of weeks ago and found a great,
inexpensive place for breakfast.  It's on the same street as Anne
Frank House, about 15 feet further down the road.  It has a red and
white striped awning and you have to step down two steps to walk in to
it.  Try the Dutch mini-pancakes with what they call icing. (It's
powdered sugar but the heat of the pancakes makes it melty and
delicious.)  The coffee is great too, but that's a constant in AMS.

Have fun.

-Chris

Sorry but I have to chime in and disagree with the warnings about the
Red Light District. Now, I do not suggest going alone, stoned late at
night, but I went in a group during the early evening before it got
too dark and it was fine. Just walk around and take in this other
world. Then get the hell out.

 OK, chiming in my tow cents. I lived there about 10 years ago for a  
year and a half. Things may have changed, haven't been back in a while.
 
Anyway- the bike suggestion is good.  There's a road near in the Oude  
West that will take you alongside a stream/river and you will pass an  
old windmill. Nice and relaxing. Another option is to ride out  
towards Amsterdammer Bos in the south. Ask directions, it's been a  
long time fro me. Also in this of the Oude West is the  
Westergassfabrik. During the day, it's a cafe (not a coffeehouse) and  
lots of artists hang out there. At night, the vibe becomes a bit more  
hip and back when I was there it turned into a nightclub.
 
One of the prettiest coffeehouses I came across is called Het  
Groenhuis. There's one near the Heineken Brouwerie and another one  
near the red light district. Nice to stop in and have a cafe verkeerd.
 
 
Foodwise- I'm not a big fan of Dutch cooking (and I even have Dutch  
roots), but Amsterdam has a huge base of Suriname and Indonesian  
immigrants. Sample some of both of these while your there. They've  
got NYC beat hands down on these two ethnic cuisines. Stay away from  
the touristy restaurants near the Leidserplein and Rembrantsplein.  
Ask around for recs.
 
I'll second the recs to visit the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseums. Avoid  
the Torture museum and the sex museum (arggh, I was subjected to  
visiting them with friends who were visiting from the states) unless  
you want to have the truly kitchy theme park experience.
 
Walk down the the Singlegracht or the Herengracht (can't remember  
which one) to catch the early morning flower market (if you're awake).
 
Visit Vondelpark.
 
I know there are some other little hidden gems I am forgetting...
 
 
Have a great time.
 
liz p

One last Amsterdam thing: Robodock 2005! NYC pals Madagascar  
Institute join pals SEEMEN in "...a unique international summer  
festival, that merges technology and art. During Robodock spectacular  
theatre acts, multi-media, visual arts, music, industrial  
installations, robots and experiments sweep the audience off their  
feet in an overwhelming flood of experiences."

 OK, chiming in my tow cents. I lived there about 10 years ago for a

Anyway- the bike suggestion is good.  There's a road near in the Oude  
West that will take you alongside a stream/river and you will pass an  
old windmill. Nice and relaxing. Another option is to ride out  
towards Amsterdammer Bos in the south. Ask directions, it's been a  
long time fro me. Also in this of the Oude West is the  
Westergassfabrik. During the day, it's a cafe (not a coffeehouse) and  
lots of artists hang out there. At night, the vibe becomes a bit more  
hip and back when I was there it turned into a nightclub.
 
One of the prettiest coffeehouses I came across is called Het  
Groenhuis. There's one near the Heineken Brouwerie and another one  
near the red light district. Nice to stop in and have a cafe verkeerd.
 
 
Foodwise- I'm not a big fan of Dutch cooking (and I even have Dutch  
roots), but Amsterdam has a huge base of Suriname and Indonesian  
immigrants. Sample some of both of these while your there. They've  
got NYC beat hands down on these two ethnic cuisines. Stay away from  
the touristy restaurants near the Leidserplein and Rembrantsplein.  
Ask around for recs.
 
I'll second the recs to visit the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseums. Avoid  
the Torture museum and the sex museum (arggh, I was subjected to  
visiting them with friends who were visiting from the states) unless  
you want to have the truly kitchy theme park experience.
 
Walk down the the Singlegracht or the Herengracht (can't remember  
which one) to catch the early morning flower market (if you're awake).
 
Visit Vondelpark.
 
I know there are some other little hidden gems I am forgetting...
 
 
Have a great time.

Sorry but I have to chime in and disagree with the warnings about the
Red Light District. Now, I do not suggest going alone, stoned late at

night, but I went in a group during the early evening before it got
too dark and it was fine. Just walk around and take in this other
world. Then get the hell out.

i'm late to reply... but here's more tips:

Definitely check out De Pijp area if you want to avoid all the red- 
light stuff.  Amsterdam is much cooler than its tourist scene.   
there's a lot of cute bars and great surinamese restaurants around  
there.

for Coffee Shops, check out the Greenhouse and Katsu (both in De  
Pijp, i think) -- Greenhouse is supposedly the champion of the  
canabis cup every year... and Katsu was my favorite spot to hang out  
when i was there... totally chilled, awesome vibe, good tea, great  
music.  also, there's a mushroom shop down the street from Rembrant  
statue in the center of town -- you'll probably see it just walking  
around there.

check out the Albert Cuyp market -- large open market that sells just  
about everything really really cheap... it's an awesome, god-sent  
market.  it's on everyday but sundays.  down the street from the  
market, there's an awesome dutch pancake shop for breakfast.

in addition to Van Gogh and the Rijks (which draws TONS of people and  
could get really crowded depending on when you go).. there are some  
good galleries to check out: Reflex, De Appel, Waag Society.  Also,  
the Stedelijk museum has good modern art collection.

and yes, i agree with renting bikes -- definitely the best way to get  
around.

The Rijks Museum is under renovations till like 2008 and that means  
that they took the 400 "most popular" paintings (Nightwatch for  
example) and put them on two floors of a wing of the building. That  
is all that is accessible. Sucks because the building itself is so  
cool, as are all of the lesser known parts of the collections. I  
would still recommend going, but it's not the same thing.

Hey don't forget to hit the coffeeshop first.  Particularly Grey

There's a place on Berenstraat or Runstraat in the Jordaan that also  
is great - they make a wicked sandwich with cream cheese, walnuts and  
honey.

Like Howard said, steer clear of the Red Light District...

Here are a few of my "dam favorites:

Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum: The Netherlands

Maritime Museum is 

housed in the National Naval Depot, a former

arsenal of the Dutch Navy 

that is over 300 years old. The unique and superb

collection tells the  

story of the maritime past of the Netherlands.

 One of my favorite places in Amsterdam. Amazing

museum of Dutch 

Maritime history. Many cool artifacts, ships,

models and art. My 

specific favorite place in the museum is the

exhibit about Jaan van 

Speik, a Dutch naval hero who gave the Dutch the

expression "I'd 

rather blow myself up," primarily used in response

to dating 

inquiries. Check it out at:  
http://www.scheepvaartmuseum.nl/index_ns.htm

Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam: One of the oldest

botanic gardens in the 

world. Today, there are more than 6,000 plants

(>4,000 species) 

growing in the garden and greenhouses. The Hortus

is located in the 

Plantage district on the edge of the hectic center

of Amsterdam. 

Behind the 300-year-old gates, however, the bustle

of the city seems 

to disappear.

 Hortus is cool. Back when the Dutch were

exploring and colonizing 

they worked very hard to bring back examples of

plants to cultivate 

and profit from at their other colonies. It was

hard to get a plant 

from Sumatra to grow in Holland. The ones that

they successfully 

managed to convey to and grow in Holland were

spread all over the 

world. Interesting. My personal fave is what I

like to call "The 

Mother of All Coffee." The first coffee plant

brought to Europe was 

cloned and is the source for all the coffee that

we drink. A clone of  

the first plant is at Hortus. If you like the

coffee, then go visit 

it's ancestor and kowtow to it. 
http://www.hortus-botanicus.nl/index.asp

The Waag Society for Old and New Media: A

knowledge institute 

operating on the cutting edge of culture and

technology in relation to 

society, education, government and industry. With

its knowledge Waag 

Society wishes to make a contribution to the

design of the information 

society. In this it doesn't let itself be lead by

technology but 

instead looks at the possibilities of people,

their creativity and 

culture. The interplay of technology and culture

is the driving force 

of all Waag Society's activities. The oldest

secular building of 

Amsterdam has a long and varied history. De Waag

was built in 1488 as 

a citygate but in the centuries that followed, the

building 

successively served as a weighhouse, guildhall,

fire station, 

municipal archives and museum for jewish history.

The various guilds 

that were housed in the building left behind clear

traces of their 

occupation. As a result, de Waag contains unique

examples of 

brick-laying that include work form the master

examinations of the 

members of the brick-layers guild.

 In 1691 the guild of chirurgeons added an

octagonal domed tower which 

housed the Theatrum Anatomicum. It was here, in

this theatre that the 

first Northern European public dissections took

place. Rembrandt was a 

regular visitor and immortalised the practice of

anatomy in his 

painting 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp'.  
http://www.waag.org/waagsite/

 The only other thing that I can say is walk

everywhere all the time. 

Amsterdam is beautiful and every neighborhood has

great stuff to 

discover. I think that the last time I was there I

must have walked 

about 10 miles a day. My feet were killing me, but

it's really a 

walking/biking town. Rent a bike! Have a great

trip!

Mighty List,

Can anyone recommend a reputable incorporation site
(where you can incorporate for a couple hundred $$ or
so). Any good/bad experiences?

Any information is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Juan

Hi,

I did it with http://www.directincorporation.com/

Because they make a free name check beforehand and then I just  
decided to go with them. The prices  were competitive. I used the  
premium package out of the convenience of getting the corp.  
stationary and the seal from them. I paid all together with the NY  
state filing fee (which in in NY 250) 495 bucks for the whole inc.  
but that included premium processing 70 in addition to the filing fee  
that I paid to do it all in one week.

But honestly... it is so little they actually do for you ( I bet all  
online services) that I would do it myself next time. They just file  
a form that you can buy at staples and send it in for you, you don't  
even have to sign it to announce the incorporation. And for the rest,  
they send you half filled in forms that you have to complete yourself  
anyway. It is not that they gave me much advice. Later then they send  
you a CD with all kind of useful info about doing business, etc.
BUT: Probably the best is to ask your accountant which way to go best  
and then do it yourself.

I also read the book "Inc. Yourself."

If you have more questions, let me  know.

BTW, the not sure if you are interested, someone asked this question  
before. I went 'bank shopping' and Commerce Bank for business was the  
best I could find. No fee for the account, no minimum balance ,  
cheaper wire transfers, 300 transactions free per month. And you get  
a banking card, which I know HSBC doesn't do for business accounts.  
Besides, they are open till 8 almost every day... I like that.

Best

m.

Beth Israel actually has an urgent care unit that is really good.  I  
was there two weeks ago with a friend.  After a 20 minute wait for  
the triage nurse in the emergency room which was really horrible, we  
were walked over to the urgent care unit, immediately given a bed and  
attention and it was fantastic.  

New York Downtown Hospital used to have a good (and fast) emergency  
room. I don't know what it's like now.

I know that the Bellvue Hospital has an excellent trauma station. Two  
friends of mine work there as, er doctors and they tell me that they  
are best equipped in the city if you had a bad accident. But that's  
probably not what you need. Not sure about the waiting time... but  
you should actually really go to a regular doctor, because you  
already waited a whole night and it is not life threatening I assume  
and it isn't a weekend, so why go to the ER? It will be tripled the  
price and less thorough care and you wait cause you are their least  
priority.
That's my five cents.

all the best!

This is the evolution of the note I sent yesterday.

This is a system to help the 1mm people who can't get through to the
governement get some answers, and potentially someone to talk with.

Could we get 10 people who would agree to be 'test call answerers'  
starting
later on today. It doesn't matter how many hours per week - 2 or 20  
-  you
can do this - just list your name, email and what times you'd be  
available
to do this.

You won't know the answers to the questions, but we'll be gathering  
what the
questions are and passing them to people to get answers.  This page
http://www.fema.gov/rrr/dafaq.shtm#1 also will have some answers.


Send me:

your name, email and what times you'd be available to do this.

Thanks,

HG

I realize this may have come across too disjointed, since the  
original note didn't make the list.

THis is an open-source 'call center 311' effort to give people  
affected by Katrina a place to call and find someone to answer,  
potentially surf the web for them and get them answers. The Red Cross  
and FEMA apparently can't answer the volume of calls and there are  
insufficient PCs and fax machines in shelters.
Additionaly, you may be a human to which they can talk to for a few  
minutes, instead of officials and others in the same situation.

See the website or join the Yahoo Group "Project800CallVolunteers"

Pass it on.

Howard

I chose the Hanes pre-washed beefy t-tshirts from Custom Ink for my  
family reunion shirts and they did a good job. Once they got the  
design it took them about 2 weeks to ship the shirts.  Although I  
can't take credit for finding them because someone else on the list  
had used them and gotten good results also.

There are several alternatives to American Appparel (AA) that my
customers buy from me.

If you are looking for something more styled/fashionable like AA I
usually recommend Bella and Canvas (men/women respectively) and AS
Tees as the two primarly alternatives.  There are other alterenatives
including some of the big manufacturers and some eco/natural lines
that I carry as well.

If you are looking for unisex or standard tees there are many options
such as Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, Champion, Gildan, Anvil, Jerzees and
many others.

If you want give me a call and I would be happy to give you some ideas
or you can check some of my items here,

Subject: FWD: Looking for Studio Space
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

This from a digital artist/friend of mine currently looking for  
studio space.. Please respond to him if you know of anything...

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
---------------

Looking for Studio:

I am looking for a studio to work in. A little about me, I am  
generally a computer based artist, though i am about to undertake a  
project that includes more traditional materials/processes.   The  
studio could be a proper art studio, or it could be a desk/work area  
in an office of designers/programmers/architects/etc.

My working process is similar to a graphic designer/web developer,  
but my interests are in line with contemporary art.  You can see more  
of my work at http://mandiberg.com .  ideally, i am looking for a  
situation where i can leave my equipment, so a lockable room is a  
goal, though i am willing to compromise on a shared space, and leave  
some of my equip in a toolbox, and bring my laptop in and out.

I am looking for a shared/semi/private studio situation.  on the  
proper-art-studio side, I do not want to work in an oil painting  
studio, or a sculpture/woodshop, b/c of my equip + the dust/noise/ 
fumes.  On the desk/work area in an office side, I dont want to be in  
a cubicle/business casual environment; i dress nice, just not that  
way.  I would use the space approx 3 weekdays per week, as well as  
weeknights/weekends.

I am looking for a smaller space, 100-200 sq ft.  My max price is  
$400, though i would much prefer to stay lower than that.  I need the  
space to have WiFi/Internet, and grounded power outlets.  Windows are  
nice.

I am also interested in finding other people in the same boat, and  
maybe looking to find a space to share together.

If you have such a space, or know of someone who does, let me know.

best,

Hi, I have a project in which I need a video doc person *in Baton  
Rouge* or environs to make a few short documentary pieces (3-4)  
minutes each.  We have the subject matter defined but there is some  
freedom to operate within it--this is, of course, pertaining to  
Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath.

Pay is $300 for doing the project + an additional $100 for each  
individual little documentary that we use (and our intention would be  
to use all the ones made).

I can give you more details, but, please, seeking someone based in  
Baton Rouge area.

Contact me at mac@heaventree.com if this is you and you are  
interested...

PS. I have some feelers out through other avenues so will take first  
person that meets what we need.

Thanks,
Mac

Second the recommendation, I love Congee Village. The place is so ugly
it's beautiful, just like your mom.

They just opened a new branch on Bowery within the last few weeks,
between Rivington & Spring. Walked past it the other night, the bar is
bigger and the wait shouldn't be as long as at the old place, although
if you make reservations there you should be fine.

Sun Golden Island restaurant in Chinatown. Very authentic Cantonese

Yummy. Big round tables. Not dirt cheap, but it's good, especially

simple enough, but i want the window to open at a certain size.  how  
do i tell flash to do this?

i've got the basic:
on (release) {	
	getURL("http://www.yadayada.html","_blank");
}

but don't know how to set size...

alternatively i feel i could set the window to open itself in a  
certain size in javascript, but i only know how to do
that from  the linking page, not the window itself.

i.e. <a href="page.html" onClick="window.open('page.html', 'page',
'status,resizable=yes,scrollbars=no,width=100,height=100', '');  
return false"> This link opens a new 100x100
window</a>

any thoughts on either way to accomplish this would be greatly  
appreciated (w/in flash preferred). my
documentation sux...
many thanks in advance!

alexandra

for the javascript to work, you also need to include this

<script language="JavaScript">
    <!--
    function spawnWindow(URL,Name,features) {
    window.open(URL,Name,features);
    }
    //-->
</script>

between <head> and body of the html page that has your flash file in it

you can also put all the JS inside Flash, avoiding the need for  
external HTML:

on (release) {
getURL ("javascript:NewWindow=window.open 
('PoppedUpWindow.html','newWin','width=400,height=300,left=0,top=0,
toolbar=No,location=No,scrollbars=No,status=No,resizable=No,fullscreen=N 
o');  NewWindow.focus();
void(0);");
}

eric, sorry to not post to your wonderful flash list

using the camera as a deck causes problems, inevitably, to the camera.
i used mine anyway as a deck (it's a sony trv900) and fixed it twice,  
until i bought a deck (sony deck mini dv/dvcam dsr11)
both my camera and deck are great

Although I use this deck too and it has been great, I
I would check out decks that also do High Def mini DV
and DV cam formats. They are usually backwards
compatible to mini DV and DV cam formats. Oh yeah, the
DSR 11 does mini DV and DV Cam as well as the NTSC and
PAL formats. Great little machine for budget minded
film/video makers.

Subject: anyone know a good place to record an album
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hey all,
 
My friend Katie is looking to go into a studio and record her second  
full length album sometime soon. she’s a folk musician, most of the  
songs will be guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. She’s been having  
trouble finding a good studio, most of the places that she’s talked  
to seem to want to charge her an incredible amount of money. She’s  
looking for something a little more high quality than a bedroom  
recording setup (which is why i’m not recording her myself), but  
something a little more cost effective than the hit factory. Anyone  
have any recommendations?
 
Thanks

Put her in contact with my husband, who's a graduate of City  
College's Sonic Arts Program (and could use some work!). They have a  
great studio there. If my husband can't record her, he can put her in  
touch with someone who can.

His name is Steve.

Tell her to mention to him that it's an ITP contact thing.

It's an A level room, but one very used to working with fok oriented  
music, in addition to just about everything else. The Magic Shop  
http://www.magicshopny.com/  and their main home page http:// 
www.magicshopny.com/mshome.html  They're on Crosby St off of Spring.
 
I worked there while I was at ITP in 92-94 as their digital guy, back  
when there weren't many of us doing digital audio.
It's a spectacular sounding room, amazing Neve console, the normal  
pro tools, tons of great vintage analog gear. Steve Rosenthal, the  
owner, is famous for his work on all the Stones reissues, and he's  
worked with everyone from Lou Reed to well, everyone. Client list is  
http://www.magicshopny.com/msclients.html The other engineers are all  
great. one of the best live drum rooms in the city.
 
Their rates are competitive, depending on who's in at the time, the  
quality is outstanding. You can have your friend talk wtih Steve or  
email him, please use my name for whatever it's worth, he will  
remember me.

I have worked with both Studio G, Brooklyn (http:// 
studiogbrooklyn.com/) as well as The Looking Glass Recording  
Studios,  NYC (http://www.glassnyc.com/.) Both are great. Studio G is  
particularly suited to perhaps more traditional type stuff while The  
Looking Glass is probably equipped to work with more non-traditional  
stuff.

my suggestion to you is go to campmoore on park place down town and get
some topo maps of north or south western corner of the catskills.

Or go to the Esopus. NY which is above Kingston...great place to start
and many a trail heads...although before that is a hugh waterfall off a
winding road off a cliff to which is actually part of a trail.

Amazing trails.

  NSA granted Net location-tracking patent

  By Declan McCullagh

  Story last modified Wed Sep 21 13:49:00 PDT 2005


The National Security Agency has obtained a patent on a method of  
figuring
out an Internet user's geographic location.

Patent 6,947,978, granted Tuesday, describes a way to discover someone's
physical location by comparing it to a "map" of Internet addresses with
known locations.

The NSA did not respond Wednesday to an interview request, and the  
patent
description talks only generally about the technology's potential  
uses. It
says the geographic location of Internet users could be used to "measure
the effectiveness of advertising across geographic regions" or flag a
password that "could be noted or disabled if not used from or near the
appropriate location."

Other applications of the geo-location patent, invented by Stephen  
Huffman
and Michael Reifer of Maryland, could relate to the NSA's signals
intelligence mission--which is, bluntly put, spying on the  
communications
of non-U.S. citizens.

"If someone's engaged in a dialogue or frequenting a 'bad' Web site, the
NSA might want to know where they are," said Mike Liebhold, a senior
researcher at the Institute for the Future who has studied geo-location
technology. "It wouldn't give them precision, but it would give them  
a clue
that they could use to narrow down the location with other intelligence
methods."

The NSA's patent relies on measuring the latency, meaning the time lag
between computers exchanging data, of "numerous" locations on the  
Internet
and building a "network latency topology map." Then, at least in theory,
the Internet address to be identified can be looked up on the map by
measuring how long it takes known computers to connect to the unknown  
one.



The technique isn't foolproof. People using a dial-up connection  
can't be
traced beyond their Internet service provider--which could be in an
different area of the country--and it doesn't account for proxy services
like Anonymizer.

Geo-location, sometimes called "geo-targeting" when used to deliver
advertising, is an increasingly attractive area for Internet businesses.
DoubleClick has licensed geo-location technology to deliver
location-dependent advertising, and Visa has signed a deal to use the
concept to identify possible credit card fraud in online orders.

Digital Envoy holds a patent on geo-location, and Quova, a privately  
held
firm in Mountain View, Calif., holds three more, one shared with  
Microsoft.

"It's honestly not clear that there's anything special or technically
advanced about what they're describing," Quova Vice President Gary  
Jackson
said, referring to the NSA's patent. "I'd have to have our technical  
guys
read it, but I don't think it impacts us in any way."

Anyone have any favorite analog joysticks that are buff enough

Thanks!

We use Happ for almost everything.  Unfortunately, the analog  
joysticks (the ones in the review are digital) that they list are pot- 
driven, which is not ideal.  Pots wear out and are not terribly  
accurate.  An optical encoder would be far better.  They have one  
listed as optical, but since there are no datasheets, I can't figure  
out if they give full analog values.  And they seem to ignore their  
phone as a matter of course.

sasha.

Bought stuff for the kids from an amazon merchant. No box, but the

Never bought from"auth.res", just some individuals.  Read between the  
lines and ask lots of questions before regarding whether or not it  
has been registered (if that matters), transfer of
license (adobe allows, but not for academic), etc. etc.

lots of legit stores use ebay nowdays, because they know that's where

ill advised...make sure it's listed as unopened in box, etc

The Madagascar Institute Presents:

Cargo Cult

Being: The culmination of years of hard labor and brutal ritual, the
final push that will get the runway done, the ancestors pleased, the
planes back, and delivered to us the abundant cargo that we so, so  
deserve;
featuring: merchant marines, brazen brass, exceedingly clever flying
machines, cardboard communication, synchronized semaphore, lighthouses,
ropework, Melanesia, control towers, morse code, dazzling displays of
ritual dance, arbitrary and capricious blood letting, sacred Jello, red
crosses, gigantic, gimpy John Frum, sea chanteys, and your helping hands
when they are needed the most.

or:

an elaborate ruse for a tramway escape to a desolate island paradise.

Beware of swashbuckling pirates, unsympathetic Red Cross workers, and  
John
Frum.  If you follow the signs and complete the ritual, you will be
amply rewarded for your faith.

Don your WWII flight suit (or similarly inspired attire), brush up on
your semaphore signals...
and chart a course for 14 Honey Locusts Park, at 59th St. betw. 1st
Ave and 2nd Ave in Manhattan.

Sunday, October 2, 4:00 pm. You will be done at dark.

Watch for the arrival of the Vanuatu Air Fleet for your first clue.
Be late and you will miss it.

Bring libations, a Metro card and be prepared to walk.

Afterparty at the Carriage House, 59th St. Bet 2nd & 3rd Ave.

Subject: Komen Race for the Cure this morning
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>


Peoples - I participated in my first Race for the Cure this morning, and
it was a truly amazing experience.
Very powerful to see so many people support the cause, and hear breast
cancer survivors tell real stories.

Part of the effort is fund raising (which I've never done before), so
here is my humble request to support me by pledging some $$ for The Race
for the Cure. All proceedes go to breast cancer research.

I ran with the Team "100 Women in Hedge Funds", and raised almost $2,000
to date (the team raised almost $40,000).
The drive continues though October 31, 2005. So, if you feel like
supporting this - here is my page.
http://www.komennyc.org/site/TR?pg=personal&JServSessionIdr011=uqiy5szbs

Thanks in advance, and sorry for being loud. This is a good cause, and I
believe in it. (And I actually RAN all 5K. :)

Yours,
Vica (Vinogradova) Miller

Hi all,

Growing up I always had dogs. Now, my dog really wants a kitten.  
There happen to be some up for adoption and I think I'm finally ready.

What do I need to get ready for him/her? What should I expect with a  
4 week old ( and older) kitten?  I know that he/she is used to being  
around a big dog ( their current home has one).

I am doing other research but know there are many cat people out  
there on the list...  thanks for any advice

Hi there,

First of all, this may come as a surprise to you, but it's true: Two  
kittens are better than one. One kitten has a huge amount of energy.  
If the energy does not have an outlet, the kitten takes it out on  
you, your furniture, your fragile objects, etc. Another kitten is the  
perfect balance for a single kitten.

Second, you want to take your kitty to the vet as soon as possible to  
get his or her tested for a variety of cat diseases (starting with  
FeLV) and vaccinated against others (like distemper). You probably  
want to put your kitten on flea medication, even if kitty will not be  
going outside.  You want a nice roomy litter box that is located away  
from his or her food dish. When you bring the kitten home, dump him  
or her into the litter box. The kitten will jump out immediately, but  
from that point on, the kitten's exploration of your home will be  
based on how far everything is from the litter box!

If the energy does not have an outlet, the kitten takes it out on  
you, your furniture, your fragile objects, etc. Another kitten is the

tho if the dog is good with cats, they could entertain each  
other...maybe ;)

you should also make sure your cat's claws are trimmed.  a cat can  
really mess up a dog if things get rough.  start trimming your  
kitty's claws right away, if you wait, he/she'll never get used to  
you messing with his/her paws.  just in general, handle your cat a  
lot when it's young, and it'll be friendlier when as it ages.

i think cats are more territorial than dogs, but i know that it's  
recommended when you move a cat in with a cat to keep the new cat  
confined for a few days so the current cat knows it's still in  
charge.  prolly not as important with a dog and a kitten.   
definitely keep the food dishes in separate places at first.

when it comes down to it, tho, cats and dogs aren't really very  
different.  just like puppies, kittens have a LOT of energy.  they  
eat a lot when they really start growing.  you can train em the same  
way, positive reinforcement/pavlov-style.  etc.

I envy you. My cat so does not want a dog. She's very loving and  
affectionate with my kids, even the one who arrived after her, but  
every time I have some one else's cat or dog over for a short term  
stay, my cat is miserable.

I was told to actually shut her up in the room with the litter box  
for her first hour in the apartment. Didn't seem like a very  
hospitable welcome, but it definitely worked for her and has worked  
for visitor cats as well. Maybe also put in that first hour room  
something impregnated with the dog's smell, like a blanket. It may be  
easier to get used to the dog's smell before getting used to the live  
dog.

Kittens love toys, especially fur-like mouse toys and small balls.

You could show both pets The Adventures of Milo and Otis over and  
over for the first few weeks of the new relationship. Even if your  
dog and new kitten don't learn anything about companionship from the  
film, you are sure to enjoy it.

I have to agree with Susan. Two cats are always better than one,  
especially when
they're kittens.

However, it's also very wise to adopt slightly older cats. For  
example, you'll
never really know if two kittens will bond.

However, if you go to Ollie's Place on 23rd and 2nd, you'll find  
pairs of cats that
have bonded strongly through their difficulties in the beginning of  
their lives.
They are usually about 1-2 years old.

A stray cat often has more trust and more love to give because of the  
new
special treatment they're receiving.

Check it out.

And I agree with John! I got my cat, the famous Scrunch the Cat  
(famous in West Philly for his rescue by a famous West Philadelphian  
who published the saga on his Web site) as a stray. He is the best  
cat. He has a worldwide fan club, I have a blog set up for him here:

If you're set on the 4-week old kitten, then none of this is particular
applicable.  If not, my girlfriend has 2 cats she's adopted from  
shelters,
worked in several animal advocacy orgs, and has told me a few things  
about
adoption over the years:

a) Adopt from a rescue org like North Shore Animal League, CACC, City
Critters, or the like

http://www.nsalamerica.org/
http://www.nycacc.org
http://www.citycritters.org/

1500-2000 cats are euthanized at the CACC alone every month because of
overpopulation.

2) As cute as they are, kittens are an unknown quantity, and their
personalities can change drastically as they  age.  Older cats  
(>2yrs) are a
more accurate reflection of how they will behave in the future.   
Also, older
cats have a much harder time getting adopted in general.

iii) If the cat isn't already, spay/neuter, spay/neuter, spay/neuter.

A friend of mine just launched a new Architecture and Urbanism blog.   
He's an accomplished architect and witty writer.  If architecture,  
urbanism, and it's emergent technologies are your thing, I'm sure  
you'll enjoy it.  Architecture isn't my thing..., but I still spent

Subject: today show transcript (was: who is running the show)
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

I'm back from vacation and obtained the transcript from the Today  
show during which it was stated that evacuation buses were delayed  
two days outside New Orleans waiting for an armed guard on each bus.

The transcript indicates that there was in fact a two delay delay  
evacuating the convention center, and that the delay was in order to  
find an armed guard for each bus.  However the report attributes the  
delay to the Governor of Louisiana, not the Bush Administration.  And  
while it seems logical that an "armed guard" would in this situation  
be a National Guard soldier with a semi-automatic weapon (as I  
stated), the report does not specify who the guard was supposed to  
be, or what weapon he or she was supposed to carry.  The NBC reporter  
also attributes the information about the delay to an unidentified  
bus driver, and the reason for the delay to an "unidentified"  
source.  ...So I guess I am not such a good journalist after all.   
Sorry for the confusion.

Nonetheless, this report indicates that the delay did happen, and for  
the ridiculous reason I stated.  I've been outside the country the  
past three weeks, so I've been out of the US media loop, but I  
haven't seen anyone picking up on this story of the delay aside from  
this mention on the Today show.  I hope this is not another example  
of an "unidentified" source providing false information.  But if the  
information is not false, shouldn't this be a much bigger story?

Anyway, here is the relevant segment of the Today Show transcript  
from Sunday September 4, with the key parts near the bottom,  
highlighted in bold:

*****

CAMPBELL BROWN, co-host (New Orleans):

It may be remembered as the most glaring example of how the federal,  
state and
local governments failed the poorest and most needy victims of  
Katrina, and
that was the New Orleans Convention Center.  It was supposed to be a  
safe
haven, and it turned into the shelter from hell.  People there were  
finally
evacuated late yesterday, as Don said, but their last day was a  
brutal one. And
we should warn you some of the pictures you're about to see may be  
disturbing.

They were dying, literally dying.  Almost a week at the New Orleans  
Convention
Center and no one came to help them, living in total filth, baking in  
the heat
without food, water or medicine.  Nine-year-old Charles Evans takes  
me by the
hand for a tour of this heartbreaking place.

Mr. CHARLES EVANS: They have several people died out here and, you  
know, I
don't want to become one of them.

BROWN: Like most people here, Charles and his family have been living  
outside.

Mr. EVANS: You want to go take a look over there?

BROWN: Yeah.

Mr. EVANS: OK, come on.

BROWN: He takes me to their spot on the sidewalk where he helps care  
for his
young cousins and sick grandmother.  They're down to just one can of  
formula
for the baby.  They had no food at all until the National Guard  
brought one
load in Friday.

Mr. EVANS: What do I need?  We need clothing, water, and food.  You  
know, but
they have several food, like several package of food, but it's not  
enough to
survive.  That's all.

BROWN: They are waiting to be evacuated, a promised pickup that hasn't
happened.  And Charles is losing hope.

Mr. EVANS: Like my grandmother says, they have more than enough buses  
why--why
not they coming and get us?

BROWN: But today will be the day, finally.

Unidentified Man #1: (Riding in SUV) The buses are coming
to...(unintelligible).

BROWN: People are told they'll have to walk three blocks to meet the  
buses, and
it is a long three blocks for the elderly...

Unidentified Woman #1: How can they walk?  Look at them, they in  
wheelchairs.
How can they walk?

BROWN: ...or if you're carrying all your possessions.

Unidentified Woman #2: Police won't help us.  We's tired of leaving  
things
behind.

BROWN: Any way they can, people make their way there only to find the  
few buses
that came have already left.

Can you guys explain to us what's going on?  Where are the buses?

Unidentified Soldier: Right now, ma'am, I couldn't tell you exactly  
where the
buses are.  The ones just left out, and I was told there were  
hundreds more
coming in.

BROWN: The National Guard troops just arrived last night and are  
doing the best
they can, but another delay is too much for some in the line.

Unidentified Man #2: She's a diabetic!  It's low or high.

*BROWN: These people have gone days without vital medicine.  At least  
this time
there is help.  Finally, the buses arrive.  We learn from one of the  
drivers
they had been sitting just 20 miles from New Orleans for the last two  
days,
told they couldn't yet move in.

Unidentified Man #3: I think it was just too dangerous to send these  
school
buses because the governor said they were going to have an armed  
guard on every
bus, and they didn't have people to put on the buses.

BROWN: Even with the looting that took place here, today it's hard to  
believe
armed guards might be needed for these passengers.
*
Unidentified Woman #3: Is it OK?

Unidentified Man #4: It's OK.  We're going to be all right.

BROWN: Some 10,000 people bused away with no idea where they're going.

VJTheory Book
Philosophy and cultural theory of vjing and realtime interaction


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Editors: Ana Carvalho and Brendan Byrne
Narrative editors: Lara Houston and Paul Mumford


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Keywords; narrative, philosophy, psychoanalysis, cultural theory,
ephemeral,
performance, technology, aesthetics, politics, ethics, realtime
processing,
collaboration, integrating media.

During AVIT UK 05 there was a fantastic level of debate based on both
the theory
and practice of VJing and realtime interactive installations and the
questions
those practices raise.

Paul and Lara have been organizing Narrative Lab, a program of lectures,
screenings, performances and projects as a major strand since of AVITUK
since
2003.  The group has been seeking to encourage debate, spark new work
arising
from theory and facilitate collaboration examining the territories of
narrative. Over the last two years the narrative Lab has hosted
lectures on
hypertextuality, meta narratives, psychogeography, screen aesthetics,
structuralism, process methodologies and various production techniques.

These theoretical debates have now expanded across many of the other
sessions.
What became apparent was the lack of written texts which attempt to
deal with
these questions which involves everybody's practice.
With this in mind we propose to gather a collection of articles and
essays which
begins to deal with these new media debates.

We see this volume as paralleling the early anthologies of film
criticism, such
as 'Movies and Methods' by Bill Nichols, containing a broad range of
analytical
perspectives relating to the new medium.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is an invitation to submit a short synopsis, propose an article or
ideas to
be published as a book.

Please send it to the following e-mail address:
vjtheory@yahoo.co.uk

Aditional information:
+ Deadline for synopsis: 30th of November
Synopsis:500 words
If possible please indicate the theoretical area where the work is
focused.
+ Initial selection based on synopsis/abstracts - 28th February 06,
contributors
will be informed as soon as possible after this date.
+ Deadline to send final papers: 30th April 06
+ Final papers between 3000 and 5000 words

I have a tv/vhs  combo that has a great picture,
only problem is that it loses
power and turns off, now frequently.

Before I drag it into a taxi and off to the tv hospital,
I was wondering if that sounds like impending death and not worth  
repair?
Or something that could be fixed for less than the cost of a new tv?
thanks-

How old is it? Life of consumer electronics is about 3 years or less.  
Pathetic, but that's what they'll tell you.
I've had TVs with good pictures repaired but the cost of a new one  
can sometimes be less than what you'll pay to repair. Understand the  
repair shop's 'bench charge' before you go there. Some apply the 50/75 
$ fee to 'look at it' towards the repair, some don't.

Sound person & Gaffer needed for work on a short film:

I'm looking for a sound person for a short I'm producing in October,  
a comedic take on a traditional comic book film.  The shoot should be  
four days.  Salary is negotiable, but probably under scale, since our  
budget is low.  We are planning to submit the film to as many film  
festivals and distributors as we can, so we're looking for the best  
crew possible! Please forward this on to anybody you think would be  
interested, and if they want to contact me, I'll send them the  
script.  The shoot dates are Oct. 18th, 19th, 21st, 22nd.

Does anyone have any suggestions for an online tool that allows users to
donate to a non-profit?

This looks good, but the commissions are too high:

Network for Good

You can open your own Verisign merchant account.

If the NFP uses BlackBaud Raisers' Edge they have a module you can  
buy that integrates pretty well, but there is some degree of manual  
work.

a very loud 2nd to this.  This show is amazing.  It's dream-like,  
cartoon-like. It's over the top.  Fantastic music.  Great acts,  
sets.  Everything.

this is a big show coming all the way from Seattle- well worth the  
$20.   I'd say its'  as big as a broadway show. But much better.

if you plan to go to a pay what you want Wed., you might not get in.   
If you have a job, pay the $20 and go another night.   In any case, go!

                InfoVis 2005
         Eleventh Annual IEEE Symposium on
            Information Visualization

               Minneapolis, MN
              October 23-25, 2005

       http://www.infovis.org/infovis/2005

InfoVis is the primary meeting in the field of information
visualization and is held in conjunction with the IEEE Visualization
2005 (Vis05) conference.  Computer-based information visualization
centers around helping people explore or explain data through
interactive software that exploits the capabilities of the human
perceptual system.  The central design challenge in infovis is
designing a cognitively useful spatial mapping of a dataset that is
not inherently spatial.

This year InfoVis has expanded to three full days.  The InfoVis
Symposium is a single track conference with both an engaging technical
program and ample opportunities for interactions with colleagues and
friends.  The technical program includes research paper presentations,
posters, results of the annual InfoVis contest, and videos, which are
new this year.  This year, the symposium includes a panel on turning
information visualization innovations into commercial products and a
special panel remembering Steve Roth and his contributions to the
field.  Keynote and Capstone speakers are
- Jim Thomas, Pacific Northwest National Labs
   "Visual Analytics: a Grand Challenge in Science -
    Turning Information Overload into the Opportunity of the Decade"
- Nigel Holmes, Explanation Graphics
   "When to draw the line (and when not to)"

We hope that you can join us in Minneapolis!

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hello

A friend of mine is currently working on a book that will eventually  
require about 160 illustrations. What is the general rate that  
someone would charge for such a large job ? The illustrations deal  
with both science topics (physics, biology, etc.) and philosophy. He  
has already made schematics of all the drawings so all that would be  
needed is to take the schematics and turn them into more polished  
illustrations. Are there places one can go on-line to find book  
illustrators ? Anyone on this list feel like they might be up to this  
job ?

Thanks

I used to be an editor of children's books, and know that we always  
preferred that projects come to us without
illustrators attached. In other words, we liked to acquire  
manuscripts and then find an illustrator that we
thought would suit the project. Sometimes, projects would come in  
with illustrations already done, and
although the text was great and something we'd be interested in  
publishing, we would nonetheless turn the
project down because we didn't like the pictures. Which is a long way  
of saying: if your friend doesn't already
have a publisher for the project, perhaps s/he should find a  
publisher first and let the publisher (who probably
will have lots of connections to professional illustrators) hire the  
illustrator?

Of course one could always find existing illustrations and just pay for
permission to use them.

consideration aside, you may want to consider going through Displaced  
Designer, http://www.displaceddesigner.com/help/request, a site set  
up through AIGA for folks in the graphic arts community who have been  
displaced by the hurricane.

one to note as well, is that in terms of cost, illustrators charge by
use. So for a small printing they will charge you less than say an
illustration to be used in a national ad campaign.  You can buy rights
for a year, or other duration.

Most of the illustration agencices I have dealt with don't do science
illustrations, so you might want to search for someone who specializes
in that. Like a place like:
http://www.science-art.com/

depending on how dynamic the site it, a program like WebSpider will  
do the trick.

Just do a search for freeware web spidering software and you'll find  
a couple.

wget (available on stage) has lots of options including -m for mirror

$ wget -m http://site.to.suck.down

that will follow every link, download all support files and more.   
check out the other options with

$ wget --help

or to be more old school try curl (comes with OSX).

My laptop got fried running on generator power, and I am hoping I can  
resuscitate it by replacing the DC Power Board, which for my model of  
laptop (Dell Inspiron 8200) is a separate component attached to the  
motherboard.  I've obtained the replacement component and taken my  
laptop apart, but now I realize I could really use a tutorial before  
going any farther.  Does anyone know of a handy tutorial or a website  
that would be able to assist me?  This operation is fairly critical  
to me, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks very much!

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>


NYCwireless September Meeting

TOMORROW--> Wednesday, September 28th, 2005 at 7:30pm sharp
NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)
721 Broadway (at Waverly Place) Room 406

A special meeting:
Everyone is invited but **space is limited**
***  RSVP is required  ***
for building admission; please RSVP by Wed. 5pm to: joe@nycwireless.net

Agenda:
1. Wireless to the rescue: Restoring communications in Katrina's  
aftermath
Report By Dustin Goodwin and Terry Schmidt

2. Controlling Interference: Cognio introduces their spectrum  
analyzer, a tool to manage growing RF interference problems

=======================================

Terry Schmidt and Dustin Goodwin have just returned from providing  
wireless communications networks in the areas devastated by Katrina.

IP network, unlicensed wireless, and VOIP are incredibly flexible  
technology that can be used to deploy data and voice communication in  
ways not possible with traditional technology. Nowhere is this more  
apparent then in disaster zone where police, fire, and storm victims  
are cut off from the rest of the world. Learn how a Naval Post  
Graduate School, Cisco, Tachyon and Redline alliance along with a  
healthy does of motivated volunteers connected three Mississippi  
towns at ground Zero of Hurricane Katrina back into the  
communications grid in only a few days.

Terry and Dustin will present their first hand accounts, including  
photos, as well as the technologies used and why.

Terry Schmidt is a co-founder, board member, and former President of  
NYCwireless. Dustin Goodwin also serves on NYCwireless Board of  
Directors, and has led NYCwireless campaign to provide free wireless  
access to Community Access Houses in Manhattan, The Bronx and  
Brooklyn. Terry and Dustin both work for Cisco.


Cognio will explain how to use their laptop spectrum analyzer to  
troubleshoot everyday RF problems. Spectrum Analyzers have the  
ability to view all RF activity not just 802.11. Cordless phone  
shutting down your Wifi network? You'll never be able to figure out  
unless it's your phone or you have a tool like Cognio's. Great for  
people looking to learn more about diagnostic tools used to  
troubleshoot wireless network problems.

Special thanks to NYU ITP for graciously hosting this month's  
NYCwireless meeting. Thanks to Red Burns, George Agudow and Nancy Lewis.

Subject: New York City's best kept secret
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hello, everyone.
 
The summer is over and a new season has begun!  I hope you are well.
 
For me there have been many changes. A lot has been keeping me busy  
lately.
 
For one, I have moved. I live somewhere else now. Lots of energy went  
into that. And lots of energy will continue to go into my new life  
living with Takako, my fiancee. That's one big change.
 
Another big change is my employment. I am now a school teacher  
working full-time at a high school in Brooklyn. Lots of energy goes  
into that too. So many of you are teachers and know exactly what I  
mean. I have been going to school to get my official certification to  
make this happen. I want to thank my teacher friends for all thier  
support during this process. And the process continues. I am still  
attending classes at New York City Tech to make my teaching job  
possible. Energy goes into that, too. Phew!
 
So, I told you about the job, the relationship and the apartment (in  
Kew Gardens, Queens).
I still need to tell you about the best kept secret in New York City.
 
Amid all of the energy and time spent in my new life, I have not told  
many folks about my 
Joel Landy and Friends performance at the 22-Below Cabaret.
 
 
The show is this Saturday, October 1st.   9pm.
(22-Below Cabaret, located downstairs at 155 E. 22 St, betw. Lex and  
3rd Aves)
$10 admission    $5 unemployed/seniors
 
The performance is part of Keep Space for Peace Week, an annual  
initiative sponsored by the Global Network Against Nuclear Power and  
Weapons in Space. You will hear more about that Saturday night. You  
will also hear from my talented and performing friends, including  
Dennis "That Dylan Guy!" Heller and Mercy Van Vlack. Also performing  
will be the talented proprietors of 22-Below, Kim Rich and Shawn  
Norton. I always enjoy performing at 22-Below. The vibes are always  
relaxed and Shawn and Kim are generous hosts. It's a real sweet place  
to play and see a show. I hope you can make it Saturday.
 
It's going to be fun and political with a few surprises, as always.
 
Come on down. Let's make a statement, sing, laugh and have some fun  
together.
 
peace love music and regime change,
 
Joel
 
See you Saturday!

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Wise List,

Can someone give me the for-dummies overview of what exactly is "Dot  
Net"? I have googled it but that has led me to only more confusion,  
as I see ASP.NET, visual basic.net, the .net platform, etc. It's hard  
to figure out even what it is, much less contemplating why or how one  
would learn it.

Any & all responses welcomed --

from wikipedia . . .

The .NET Framework created by Microsoft is a software development  
platform focused on rapid application development (RAD), platform  
independence and network transparency. .NET is Microsoft's strategic  
initiative for server and desktop development for the next decade.  
According to Microsoft, .NET includes many technologies that are  
designed to facilitate rapid development of Internet and intranet  
applications.
.NET has brought new functionalities and tools to the application  
programming interface (API). These innovations allow programmers to  
develop applications for both Windows and the web as well as  
components and services (web services). .NET provides a new  
reflective, object-oriented API. .NET is designed to be sufficiently  
generic that many different high-level languages can be compiled.
The .NET framework is a competing product to Sun's Java and J2EE  
technology and it shares many concepts with it.
There is a collection of development tools specifically developed for  
use with the .NET platform. The principal example is Visual  
Studio .NET, an integrated development environment from Microsoft.

Almighty List,

So I'm giving a talk on Friday and just realized I have no business
cards to give out, what are my options for good fast cheap 4/1 printing
in the city? Online is my second choice because of shipping costs, and
if I'm doing online printing I'll probably use 4by6.com, unless anyone
has cheaper but still solid suggestions.

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Dear ITP alumni,

I need someone who can help me to do the project (paid).  My client  
is trying to launch a new fashion brand.  Basically they don't need a  
lot things.  A little bit of sound, flashing pictures transition,  
rotating a small logo and so on..  A person who can do all the Flash  
cliche quickly, please send an email to me off the list with your  
latest project.  How much are you getting paid for?  Not too much, we  
can negotiate.  I guess not too bad.

Thanks!

Subject: the freelance job that wouldn't die
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Wondering if anyone that's had this problem before can give me some  
advice...

I have a freelance job that was supposed to end July 1st but is still  
dragging along...
We had a 3 week testing period last june, during which time all  
reported bugs were fixed and confirmed (by the client) to be fixed.
But here and there since the supposed delivery date, more minor bugs  
have poppped up... I've been fixing them for free even though I  
received final payment on the job and really consider it done. At  
what point should I start billing for these? And how do I explain  
myself to the client? My attitude is kind of that all software has  
bugs and that's why multiple versions get released... Is that an  
unreasonable way to look at the situation?

thx...

depending on the relationship with the client, i would say that you  
should
never do work for free, especially afer the job has been signed off on.
once the job is done, it's done. if they signed off saying it was ok,  
then
that's the end. if they change their mind later, you should offer to  
help,
but for your normal hourly rate. the idea that software has bugs is not
unreasonable i think.

Ugh. I feel your pain, I've had a few of these recently.

I suppose it depends on what's in the statement of work, or contract
(assuming there is one). If there is, you can probably initiate a
conversation in which you say that you feel all the promised  
functionality
exists and any forthcoming changes are "feature updates" and not "bug
fixes". in which case you'll need a new contract and you get to start
billing again (yay!). Even if no contract exists, you can probably  
make this
case, and at least see what they say. it probably will depend on the  
nature
of the new bugs, if they are continuing problems with the initial
deliverable, or if the program works within a certain agreed upon  
framework
and now it's being asked to do new things, and as a result, new bugs are
popping up.

Almost always, in the contract is a clause that talks about what to  
do if the project runs over.  It really depends on what you singed on  
for - to do a contracted work for a certain number of hours, or to  
deliver a fully-functional and bugless piece of software.  Also, make  
sure to warn the people whom you work for that "this is the last bug  
fix and I've worked a lot of hours over contract."  I have to say -  
I've made this mistake before, thinking that I've warned them that  
the project is going overtime and my contract doesn't cover it, when  
in fact I haven't pushed hard enough.


good luck!

Last winter a very good client of mine who's a very senior level
exeuctive of mine had refered me to a not-for-profit group for some
consulting/advice. I was under the impression my good client was
working with that not-for-profit and that she was enlisting me to give
pro bono advice.

Later after the consulting was done my client was surprised to hear
that I hadn't sent them a bill. Her response was "Morry this is
business you have to send people bills." I sent a bill and not only
did they pay me right away they called me and thanked me profusely for
saving them money with the advice and then a few months later they
hired me again.

I learned something valuable form this experience- when you are a
professional you have to bill for your time and people not only
understand they expect it. If you want to be treated like a
professional you have to behave like one. Professionals charge for
their services unless it is otherwise agreed. If you haven't agreed
otherwise you should send them a bill. What's the worst that will
happen?  They won't pay you? Then you wil be in the same position you
are now.

They might say they don't want to pay and they thought these were bug
fixes etc. but stand your ground and state just what you have, or you
could say well since it wasn't clear I'll give you the benefit of the
doubt and discount your invoice but going forward please understand
all work will be billed at $x/ hour.

Hi, has anyone found a discount airline that flies to montreal?   
JetBlue doesn't go there and the flights I'm finding for a random  
December weekend are a bit high. 
Thanks,

i've been finding good rates lately on hotwire.com  also i was shocked
last monhth to see that the price to go from nyc to montreal on Amtrak
was less than nyc to dc or nyc to baltimore.  yeah it's a long trip
but it's supposed to be beautiful.

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

share available immediate until feb 1 (with possible renewal) in a  
large, renovated working loft with 5 other media people. Those who  
work there now are primarily animators, interactive, + computer  
artists, none of whom are there at the same time.

The media studio is located at North 3rd in Williamsburg near the  
water in a building known for its many artists and curators. Space is  
big and open, clean (no sink except in bathroom down the hall), has  
wifi, and you have 1/3 of the space. There is a couch, fridge,  
coffeemaker etc also in the space and folks are generous and good  
natured.

Looking for reliable person with references, ITP alum or someone  
active in media preferred. A designer or physical computing person  
would be ideal-- there is an oscilloscope and bench in the space as  
well.

Rent is $550 month incl utils. Current tenant has received residency  
and will be gone much of the fall.

Does anyone have suggestions about visiting the Galapagos?  My

i looked into it once.  i'm not sure if i am remembering correctly,
but i don't think you can stay on the islands (unless maybe in a tent)
because they are nature preserves.  i don't think the boats are
necessarily fancy either.

You might be able to stay on the islands (not sure, as they are a
protected nature reserve). From what I heard from people who went there,
you either do a "fancy" cruise, or you travel there by air from either
Ecuador or Guatemala. But ticket prices bite - from around $1,000 per
person (I might be wrong). However,  this is the figure I remember from
last time we checked, so we ended up going to Costa-Rica, Guatemala and
Belize instead. Great stuff.

I may be a little late on this thread (no pun intended).  But check  
out Lands End [landsend.com]– they have terrific men’s shirts,  
great value and one of the best e-commerce websites anywhere.  I  
particularly like the pinpoint cotton shirts.

They have a no-questions-asked returns policy (no time  
limit).  Excellent value.  They’ll send you free fabric swatches  
and once you find your size, you can go online and order anytime.  I  
even got a little monogram on the pocket of an oxford shirt for a  
laugh!  While you are on the site, you can call their 800 number and  
ask questions.

The overstock/close-out section of their website is also worth a look.

Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Hi Listland,

Organizing a small group tour of some swanky,  trendy, posh and  
classy bar-lounges as a research project. Any suggestions for some  
good places to check out. Mostly looking for nice spots to hang out.  
So the tour will take place this Saturday and its a group of 8-12  
people. I'm mostly targeting Lower Manhattan, but will take the whole  
island on, just maybe not this Saturday. Will do these for a few  
Saturdays, starting with this weekend. The idea is to run a recon  
mission to get a flavor for different bars in NYC.

Also worth noting is we'll start on 5th heading down to 14th street.  
So we'll pass Lemon, the W, Sushi Samba, etc. We'll go East to West  
and pick up the middle stuff on the way west.

Target demo is 21-35. Thanks,

- Nakiso

I have often bought dress shirts at Macy's which has
many brands and usually good prices, but the best
dress shirts I have are from Brooks Brothers. They
just seem to be made with really great quality.  I
can't remember how much they were, but it was more
expensive than the Macy's purchases. You can save a
few bucks from their Manhattan stores if you go to
there outlet store in Jersey Gardens mall near Newark
Airport. And there is no tax on clothing in NJ.

For men's clothing, Daffy's is a hidden treasure.  I keep hearing  
that from some friends who like to shop.  I did help few friends  
shopping there.  Also noticed well dressed gentlemen were shopping  
there - a good sign.  They have one on 5th Ave somewhere near 17th  
street & also near BAM.

Great for men but not for women.  :-)

Veering off-topic, Daffy's is great for baby cloths. Don't know about
anything else there, but have always found great stuff for youngsters.

Yeah Filene's rocks, it's right near where I work on 18th & 6th.  I  
bought a designer shirt for about $69, then found 3 more of the same  
designer shirts in Filene's for about $15-20 each.

Late response from the digest:

For really fancy stuff, check out these (prices bite)

Tiny italian boutique on West Broadway near Broom
Costume National at 108 Wooster St
Kirna Zabete at 96 Greene Street
IT on Broom (?)
Etro at 720 Madison Ave
Don't forget BARNEYS ! :)

So save $$, go look for the same brands at Century 21 or Woodbury
Commons outlets

Good luck

That's not extremely expensive.  to fix a bad drive, you have to get  
a clean room and physically remove the platter, place it into a new  
drive.  If you have access to a clean room and a plethora of drive  
parts, you're in luck.  If not, it's well out of most people's price  
range to rent one (is that even possible?)

If the drive hasn't totally died yet, make it very cold (blow an air  
conditioner on it, or something) and then try to copy everything off  
it.  That's your only hope.  this is why a $200 backup drive make so  
much sense, in hindsight...

Sorry for the multiple post, but I heard from a few people that the  
web site wasn’t working on IE for Mac.
 
I have tweaked it a bit and it should work for everyone now (damn you  
mac IE!!!).   Drop me an email if you have any questions.

Subject: chirping laptop power supply --total weirdness!!
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

After getting such great assistance with my first question today, I  
thought I'd put a follow up question to the experts on the list.

I managed to successfully repair my Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop by  
replacing a fried DC Power Board with a spare. That is, everything  
seems groovy, except it has been making strange squeaking/ chirping  
noises in a regular pattern ever since.

I am getting a quick chirp every 11 to 12 seconds or so, and every 12  
to 13 minutes I get much longer warbling chirps that start quietly  
and grow louder until they end in a high-pitched crescendo roughly 30  
to 70 seconds later.

These squeaks and chirps happen whether the laptop is on or off, as  
long as it is connected to a power supply (but not when it is running  
on battery power).

What gives?? These noises are very distracting. Do they also signal a  
more dangerous problem?

Thanks in advance for any assistance.

I think it is a short in your power supply.  I'm on my second power
supply for a similar Dell laptop and both have succumbed to a chirping
short.

uh oh.  that scares me.  But the noise seemed to get gradually  
quieter the closer my battery came to being fully charged, and to has  
stopped not that it is.  Would this disqualify it from being a  
short?  I dunno.

BTW, the chirp is coming from the vicinity of my new DC Charger  
board.  Otherwise I'd say maybe it is my battery complaining that it  
is hungry when mommy is present with food.

if it is not a short, it is some sort of loose connection.  if it is
really a short your charger would stop working intermittently.

it might be an intermittent short...  is there any change in the  
chirp if
you rap on it? (if it was a dead short, it would have exploded by now)

thanks for the advice-- you guys have convinced me another operation  
is necessary.  Come to think of it, the laptop does seem to be hotter  
than usual in the area of the DC Charger Board.  Preparing the

Anyone know where I can get some cheap Polaroid 500 (formerly known as
Captiva) film in the city? A friend gave me a Polaroid P500 printer and
I want to try printing photos out with it for a show I'm supposed to be
in. Is B&H my best bet?

i guess the verity of the statement depends on what you define as
equivalency.

i would not say that an MPS connotes a mastry of one or more traditional
arts as does an MFA. however, both are terminal degrees in their
respective fields. the MPS just happens to refer to a different and more
commercially exploited (right now) medium than does the MFA.

i believe that the old ITP site had some copy that talked about the MPS
being a terminal degree, but i don't seem to see it anywhere on the new
site. my advice is to email george or midori and see if they can furnish
you with something in writing that explains the MPS and/or its
relationship to the MFA.

incidentally, i normalls side step this whole issue by saying that i  
have
a Masters in 'experimental technology' or 'interactive  
telecommunications'

hope this helps.

Hello,

I'm sure this has been asked before, but I've searched all the old list
articles in my inbox about photo labs and couldn't find anything.

I need to hi quality prints form 4X5 Corm transparencies made of a
client.  I'm starting to hate every lab I go to. Babboo, 18th st, seem
to be getting worse.  I can't think of the last time I was really happy
with a print I had made.  Does anyone have a Professional lab they
really love?


Thanks,

Hi,
I use Manhattan color labs (20th St) mostly ( Babboo really sucks big  
time) , they have decent prices, do a good job and never screwed up  
for me. But if I wanted to have the best work and the client pays, I  
would still use Duggal. Though they always screw something minor up,  
the thing never seems to go smooth, like they can't find the job and  
have to do it again... etc.

But hey, the world isn't perfect.

Hi,

I use L&I on w17 btw 5 + 6 or their 22nd street loc btw 5 & 6. Color  
Edge is not too bad either. Flatiron isn't bad too. It really all  
depends for B+W i use Lexington Black + White which is now part of  
Color Edge and they are great.
They will use whatever chemical you prefer, most places defer to T- 
Max but if you want X-tol they are the only one's i know who will  
offer you a range. FlatIron does it too for 4x5 film. Also Lex & Flat- 
iron do dip and dunk.

Don't use ColorEdge, they are under new management this year and they  
are BIG BIG ASSHOLES!  Quality has gone way down, they are over  
priced and did I mention they are real jerks?

C-Lab is decent and you can get a discount for paying up front.  My  
favorite lab Bond Street Print Lab, I don't think makes prints from  
Chrome film but maybe.  Never tried Flatiron but I haven't heard  
anything bad about them either.  Duggal can be good.... it just  
depends if someone way more important than you has a job at the lab.

Hey Marion,

The B+W too? I haven't been to CEdge for a while and heard they had  
switched over to a new company. That would suck, although the B+W  
never functioned like CEdge. Wow!

Well L & I is still really great. I've done a bunch of chrome 4x5 to  
24x17 and they were great!

modernage on 6th ave around 42nd street.  they print
for some pretty amazing photographers, and they do all
the work for icp - among others.  they're both black
and white and color, digital and traditional.  peter
gravina's the best customer service guy there.

i haven't been to coloredge lately, but my one
experience with them about a year ago really creeped
me out.  i'm with marion - stay away.

Hi Listland,

Yes, I have referred to the bigger brain (a.k.a Google) but I thought  
I would ask the wise oracle land of list. I'm trying to find out how  
many South American beer varieties are available or that people know  
about. They don't have to be in NYC, but it would be great. So the  
Beer afficionados might know. I mean everything including micro-brews  
etc. Thanks,

A big whole bunch of them.
You'll start seeing Brahma everywhere - delis on the E village have  
it already. Good beer.
they just launched internationally. I friend of mine reported seeing  
that everywhere in Russia and Estonia.
Also, those specialty shops with a hundred different bottles on the  
window have a few others...
I'd say keep an eye for

Baden Baden
Bohemia
Xingu
Original

But since you are opening a cool bar, It's Cachaça you should worry  
about!
Stay away from Pitu, Velho Barreiro and Ypioca. (or use it to  
degrease your bike)
but keep an eye on cachaças (aka Pinga) from Minas Gerais, specially  
the Salinas region.
They can get as good as (some say better than) 12y whiskey...

Doh! Sherlock got me again!!!!!

Shhhhh! That is half correct! I'm exploring....exploring the  
possibilities of being a beer drinker with a South American focus.  
The bars (aka bar hoppin') are on behalf of a friend who has a bar in  
the LES, an excellent wine spot focusing on Southern Italian  
vino....exquisite! They have vino to die for. So he's curious about  
the competition...and so we're doing a group check out what the  
competitors are doing thingy.

The second is a request for another friend who is convinced that  
there is a poor representation of SAmerican beers, I can't argue or  
confirm/deny since i don't know beer (nor drink it for that matter!).

But were i to start a bar, i will broadcast and listee's would be  
invited one and all, for my beer would be interactive, as well :)

You can touch your beer and say hhmmmm. And Super Dave (shout-out to  
Dave Derby) and his band could play while Goldie + Carlos hit us with  
some maxxed out video funk

I love beer, and I love cachaça, but separated!
Although if you like Tequiza beer (beer with tequila), you might also  
like Samba (which I never tried...)

A big whole bunch of them.
You'll start seeing Brahma everywhere - delis on the E village have  
it already. Good beer.
they just launched internationally. I friend of mine reported seeing  
that everywhere in Russia and Estonia.
Also, those specialty shops with a hundred different bottles on the  
window have a few others...
I'd say keep an eye for

Baden Baden
Bohemia
Xingu
Original

But since you are opening a cool bar, It's Cachaça you should worry  
about!
Stay away from Pitu, Velho Barreiro and Ypioca. (or use it to  
degrease your bike)
but keep an eye on cachaças (aka Pinga) from Minas Gerais, specially  
the Salinas region.
They can get as good as (some say better than) 12y whiskey...

I guess Mexico doesn't technically qualify as South America but if  
you are interested....
Casta is a great microlabel  from Monterrey with a few different ales  
that are very tasty. The two large beer distributors in Mexico are  
Cerveceria Cuahtemoc Moctezuma and Grupo Modelo. Cerveceria Cuahtemoc  
produces Noche Buena which is a great lager if you can get your hands  
on it (only available around the Christmas Holidays). They also  
produce Bohemia and XX both of which you already know and may or may  
not convinced by but also Indio a local mainstream beer I drink  
regularly. I also like Victoria on an average day which is  
distributed by Grupo Modelo, the same people who distribute Negro  
Modelo in the states. They also produce two tasty if not extravagant  
beers Leon (Munich style) and Montejo (a pilsner) at their brewery in  
the Yucatan peninsula which is pretty close to being South America.

I don't know if it's true of South America but pretty much all of the  
beers in Mexico originally come from German or Austrian recipes  
anyway. If you want to experience a truly Mexican beverage try  
pulque, a fermented drink produced from the Maguey cactus. Next time  
you're in Mexico City I'll take you to the pulqueria around the  
corner from where I live for a few curados. It's not exported because  
it can't be bottled or preserved.

Also in the non-SA category but close geographically and outstanding

Bolivian beer or bier

The majority of Bolivians would not be surprised by Delays step down
because curription is everywhere.  Who is to blame?  Certainly Bolivian
politicians.  Their grafting is legendary and thus everybody is on the
take, from mayor to beat cops.

Reciently Chavez from Venezuela blamed the US for Bolivia's troubles.

so here is some very political beer in a very political country.

Pacena is the largest owned beer company that is owned by a former truck
driver for the company.  Maybe he was shipping more than beer?  other
beers include
El Inca, Brock, Centarnario, Astra, Potosina, and Cochabamba's Taquina.


take a look at the labels

You are missing Colombian Beer:
The Big Ones -
Bavaria
Club Colombia
Aguila
Polar (Venezuela)

There is also a mircro brewery in Bogota that produces
really good lagers, bocks, porters, ambers, etc. It's
called something like "Bogota Brewery Co."

Since Jaime is not telling us how pulque is fermented here it goes:

"Pulque makers sometimes use various fruit to accelerate  
fermentation. In traditional pulque,
a muñeca ("doll") was used - a rag or sock filled with human feces  
and dipped to start the
fermentation process."

enjoy your curadito Jaime.

Since Jaime is not telling us how pulque is fermented here it goes:

enjoy your curadito Jaime.

Wow that's quite a sentence... I think you are looking for a company  
with a milling machine.

These guys are excellent, but often busy:

Subject: movable type question... (auto linking url)
Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

hi there awesome listies

so i've been looking for this for a while, and now it's getting  
really annoying... i can't seem to find a plug-in or some kind of  
trick that would allow for automatic linking of URLs in blog posts...  
i think i'm googling for the wrong thing, but i don't know what a  
feature like this might be called.

basically, i want to be able to type the url and when it's posted, MT  
figures out that it should put the <a href > tag around it.

b/c you can do the same in wordpress, and it's just a matter of  
regular expression parsing (though, i'd rather not sit here and  
figure it out myself, i'm too busy blogging)...

anyone know?

thanks!
ann

Might be different depending on what version of MT you're using but

Good people
 
My good friend (and my amazing dentist) Dr. Fred Solomon is going  
paragliding to Turkey October 5-15, and needs a live-in dog sitter  
for that period.
If
-you love dogs
- work in the city (or free-lance remotely)
- can walk and feed dogs as instructed
- and don’t mind spending ten days either in his gorgeous loft in  
Tribeca http://www.tribecasmiles.com/  or in the cliff house in

Then
–         this is a great opportunity to live in great digs  
while helping a great person.
 
I’d do it – but my husband and two dogs might not like it. J The  
dogs are here http://www.tribecasmiles.com/freshening.html  
 
All details – please call Danielle, Fred’s girlfriend at  
908-531-3631. Mention my name
 
ONLY SERIOUS AND RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE PLEASE. We are talking lives here. J

One of my friends is helping organize at Robonexus, and as a result, the
Robotics Society of America has a large booth at the convention. The RSA
is extending an invition to anyone who would like to show their work to
do so at the RSA booth.

Although the theme is robotics, it is pretty broadly defined, and I
think that many of the interesting projects I've seen in this group
would be well received at Robonexus.

Please contact Simone directly if you have any questions:

The Robotics Society of America is working with Robonexus again this  
year
(http://www.robonexus.com) for the Robonexus Conference on October  
6-9th.  They
have given us a HUGE space which we would like to fill with interesting
robotics
projects and the people who build them.

Participants will get free convention passes and a nicely placed  
booth space
right in the middle of the convention floor. The event is held at The  
San Jose
Convention Center, and it is one of the largest industrial and  
amateur robotics
events in the country. We would like all types of projects, finished and
unfinished.  We are looking for everyone from the university-sponsored
autonomous vehicle to the cobbled-together mad-scientist special.

The event if free of chjarge for exhibitors. Please contact Simone at
Simone@robotics-society.org if you are interested.

hi listers,

now that i know where to find a good shirt,  i find myself and my  
very-significant other needing a new place this coming Dec/January.   
much as we love roosevelt island, we're a little tired of living in a  
place with one restaurant and only two choices for food delivery  
services.  i bet there's some great brooklyn real estate blog or  
website out there, with some nice and cheap, low-hanging-fruit of an  
apartment just waiting for the two of us.  um... i hope there is.   
does anyone know of anything (besides craigslist, of course) that  
fits the bill?? we're looking to rent, most likely, unless there's a  
good deal out there to buy.  any good tips?

thanks,
-ev

This sounded interesting (but the website doesn't appear to be all  
built yet):
